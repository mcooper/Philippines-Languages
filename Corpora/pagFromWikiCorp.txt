== Historiya ==
The town had its humble beginnings in 1770 as a farming village when it was founded by Don Mariano del Pilar de los Reyes and named it Barrio Del Pilar. It was in a productive agricultural area between the towns of San Luis in the North and Apalit in the South. As the population kept on growing in the local community, the leading citizens of the progressive village initiated a petition to consolidate a portion of the southern part of the town of San Luis and a land area from the northern part of the municipality of Apalit to form an independent municipality.
Appraised of the economic potential of a new town and confidence in the management capability of the leaders, the Spanish Governor General at the time during his second term as chief administrator of the Philippines, Don Simón de Anda y Salazar approved the official creation of the town on November 15, 1771.
The town was named in honor of the Spanish Governor General who approved its creation and of the Apostle Simon Peter, the Patron Saint of the illustrious town of Apalit. Like any other typical Spanish town (pueblo) it was administered by a “Capitan del Pueblo” and had a municipal policy making body called today as Municipal Council. The Catholic Parish Church, the Public Market, the Town Plaza and homes of prominent families were located within the proximity of the Municipal Hall. The people of San Simon celebrate two town fiestas, one in honor of Lady of the Pillar, the patron saint of the first barrio and the other in honor of the Apostle Simon Peter. In 1898, the retreating military forces of General Antonio Luna on their way to Nueva Ecija burned the parish church.
Among the early settlers of the town were the de los Reyes, de los Santos, Macapagal, Pangan, Punzalan, Puyat, Santos and Simbulan families.
In 1904, the town of San Simon was merged with the municipality of San Luis and about three years after, it became again an independent municipality. In 1920, the geographical boundaries of San Luis, Apalit and San Simon were officially established.
In 1979, through the effort and financial contributions of the Ibanez, Guevarra, Santos, Punsalan, Pangan and other families, the church was rebuilt and named as Nuestra Senora Del Pilar.


== Saray politika tan gobiyerno ==
Like other towns in the Philippines, San Simon is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head and leads the town's departments in executing the ordinances and improving public services. The vice mayor heads a legislative council (Sangguniang Bayan) consisting of councilors from the Barangays of Barrios.


=== Municipal Government ===
Just as the national government, the municipal government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative and judiciary. The judicial branch is administered solely by the Supreme Court of the Philippines. The LGUs have control of the executive and legislative branch.
The executive branch is composed of the governor for the provinces, mayor for the cities and municipalities, and the barangay captain for the barangays.Local Government Code of the Philippines, Book III, Department of Interior and Local Government official website. The legislative branch is composed of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (provincial assembly) for the provinces, Sangguniang Panlungsod (city assembly) for the cities, Sangguniang Bayan (town assembly) for the municipalities, Sangguniang Barangay (barangay council), and the Sangguniang Kabataan for the youth sector.
The seat of Government is vested upon the Mayor and other elected officers who hold office at the Town hall. The Sanguniang Bayan is the center of legislation.


=== Tanod ed Ehekutibo ===
Available records at the Municipal Hall list the following town executives from 1898 until present:


== Ekonomiya ==
The principal industries in San Simon are farming, fishing and poultry and swine industries. There are two public markets in San Simon, one in the old poblacion area and another one located in the industrial zone area.
Following the advancement of technology and industrialization, the climate for investment in San Simon is very promising because of its geographic location and the incentives initiated by Mayor Manuel S. Bondoc and the Municipal Council presided then by Vice Mayor Azor L. Sitchon. Through their effort and efficient leadership, the town with an annual gross income of about 500,000.00 Philippine pesos in 1988 as a 6th class municipality became a 4th class municipality with an annual gross income of more than 3,500,000 Philippine pesos by the end of the 20th century. When Mayor Azor L. Sitchon, an Economics graduate with honors from the famed Ateneo de Manila University took over the administration as elected mayor, he not only continued the completion of the projects and programs of his predecessor, Mayor Manuel S. Bondoc but he also initiated his own new economic programs and infrastructure projects including a modern public market and a new Municipal Hall along the national highway in barrio San Agustin (Tulauc) and made it centrally accessible from all directions. Barrio San Agustin (Tulauc) became a commercial center and the seat of municipal government, thus contributing to the increase of municipal tax revenues. Total target tax revenues from business taxes, real property taxes and other fees were projected to be more than 7,000,000.00 Philippine pesos. It is acknowledged that the significant economic growth in San Simon was brought about by the Comprehensive Municipal Development and Land Use Plan enacted by the Municipal Council. The zoning ordinance reclassified the entire stretch of Quezon Road as Industrial and Commercial Zone, but limited only to light and medium size industries and those that are environmental friendly.
Another factor that contributes to the potential economic growth of San Simon in the 21st century is its geographic location. It is strategically located in the central part of the “W” Growth Corridor of Central Luzon and it is accessible from major road networks and arteries coming from the different provinces of Central Luzon and Metro Manila. From the North Luzon Expressway, one can take an exit through the San Simon Toll Plaza, which is about 45 kilometers from Metro Manila and seven kilometers from San Fernando City, Pampanga and approximately 20 kilometers from the Clark Special Economic Zone in Angeles. City.
Taking advantage of the conducive local business environment, tax incentives and availability of skilled workers, many manufacturing and commercial firms have been established or relocated in San Simon. The infusion of private capital investment was about ten billion pesos and expected to increase to more than twenty billion pesos by the early years of the 21st century.


=== Saray karsada tan tulay ===
The national and local government of San Simon have provided transportation and bridge services to the residents. Because of the infrastracture, mango orchards and the rice industry were boosted.


== Edukasiyon ==
For elementary and high school education, residents of San Simon are served by thirteen elementary schools, two barangay public high schools, and three private schools.


== Saray panawagan ==
For telecommunications, the town is served by Digitel, PLDT, PILTEL, DATELCOM, SMART, and GLOBE. Another wireless internet service provider is COMCLARK SureStream.


== Turismo, Heritage, Relihiyon tan Kultura ==
The town is rich in its past and treasures. Its town hall and churches reveal the wealth of the town's heritage.


==== (Heritage) Church ====
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Fernando has jurisdiction over the 1771 Virgen del Pilar Parish Church.

Like most Kapampangan people, residents of San Simon retain their Kapampangan language and traditional culture and arts brought about by their Malay ancestors and enriched by Chinese, Spanish, American, Japanese and other ethnic and foreign cultures.
Catholic 80%,
Members Church of God International 10%

== Juan 3:16 ==
Matatagpuan sa Juan 3:16 o Kabanata 3, taludtod bilang 16 ng Ebanghelyo ni Juan ng Bibliyang Kristiano ang pariralang bugtong na Anak. Ito ang taludturan o bersong tinawag na ang "Mabuting Balita sa loob ng isang balat ng mani" dahil naglalaman ito ng kabuuran ng isa sa pinakamahalagang mga panuntunan o doktrina ng Kristianismo, na nilalahad ng paganito batay sa Bibliyang Tagalog na salin ni Amado Espino, gobernador ng lalawigan ng Pangasinan:

Ta ontan la’y impangara na Dios ed mondo, ya inter to so bogbogtong ya Anak to, pian sio-paman á manisia ed sikato agnatawtaw, no ag wala so bilay to’n andi angaan.
– Juan 3:16 Pangasinense (Gobernador Amado Espino)


=== Saray bersion ed Tagalog ===
Bukod sa sipi mula sa Bibliyang salin ni Amado Espino sa itaas, naririto ang ilan pang mga kinatawang halimbawa ng taludturang Juan 3:16 na naglalaman ng pariralang bogbogtong ya Anak to, o bugtong na Anak o kadiwang parirala, at nasa ibang wika:

Oo, gayon na lamang ang pagmamahal ng Diyos sa daigdig kaya ibinigay niya ang kanyang bugtong na Anak upang ang lahat ng mga sumasampalataya sa kanya ay huwag mapahamak kundi bagkus magkamit ng buhay na walang hanggan.
– Juan 3:16 (Abriol)

Lubos na iniibig ng Diyos ang sanlibutan kaya ipinagkaloob niya ang kaniyang bugtong na anak upang ang sinumang sumampalataya sa kaniya ay hindi mapahamak kundi magkaroon ng buhay na walang hanggan.
– Juan 3:16 (JH/HB)

Gayon na lamang ang pag-ibig ng Diyos sa sanlibutan kaya ipinagkaloob niya ang kaniyang bugtong na Anak upang ang sinumang sumampalataya sa kaniya ay hindi mapahamak kundi magkaroon ng buhay na walang hanggan.
– Juan 3:16 (TBW/Biblista)

Sapagkat gayon na lamang ang pag-ibig ng Diyos sa sangkatauhan, kaya't ibinigay niya ang kanyang kaisa-isang Anak, upang ang sinumang sumampalataya sa kanya ay hindi mapahamak, kundi magkaroon ng buhay na walang hanggan.
– Juan 3:16 (BMBB/AngBiblia.net)

Sapagka't gayon na lamang ang pagsinta ng Dios sa sanglibutan, na ibinigay niya ang kaniyang bugtong na Anak, upang ang sinomang sa kaniya'y sumampalataya ay huwag mapahamak, kundi magkaroon ng buhay na walang hanggan.
– Juan 3:16 (Say Sigud ya Biblia, 1905)

Gayon na lamang ang pag-ibig ng Dios sa sanlibutan, na ipinagkaloob niya ang kanyang bugtong na Anak, upang ang sinumang sa kanya'y sumampalataya ay hindi dapat mapahamak, kundi magkaroon ng buhay na walang hanggan.
– Juan 3:16 (Mayor Carolyn Grace's Bible in Puerto Galera)

Bicol Region or Bicolandia is one of the 16 regions of the Philippines occupying the Bicol Peninsula at the southeastern end of Luzon island and some other islands.
It consists of six provinces, namely, Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes, Masbate, and Sorsogon. It has one independent chartered city, Naga City, and six component cities, Iriga City, Legazpi City, Ligao City, Masbate City, Sorsogon City, and Tabaco City. The inhabitants speak one of the Bikol languages, Masbatenyo, or a Warayan language, and the commercial/financial centers and transportation hubs are Legazpi City, the Regional Center and the Gateway City to Bicolandia, and Naga City, The Heart of Bicol and The Home of Our Lady of Peñafrancia.
The Bicol region is often seen as the epicenter of the counterculture and liberal politics in the Philippines.

The Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) of the Philippines is a land-locked region consists of the provinces of Abra, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga, Mountain Province and Apayao. Baguio City is the regional center. The Cordillera region encompasses most of the areas within the Cordillera Central mountain range of Luzon, the largest range in the country. This region is home to numerous indigenous tribes collectively called the Igorot.
The Cordillera Administrative Region is the only landlocked region in the country.


== Economy ==
Cordillera has abundant mineral reserves. These include metallic ores such as gold, copper, silver, zinc, and non-metallic minerals like sand, gravel and sulfur. Mineral reserves are found in all the provinces. However, mining is concentrated in Benguet.


== Geography ==


=== Political Divisions ===
CAR is subdivided into 6 provinces and Baguio City.

¹ Baguio City is a highly urbanized city; figures are excluded from Benguet Province.


=== Physical ===
Almost the whole region is situated in the mountainous Cordillera Central range. Located there is Mount Pulag, the second highest mountain in the country, rising at 2,922 meters. Various rivers start here, like the Cagayan River and the Agno River.


== Tourist attractions ==
Tourist attractions in the region include the world famous Banaue Rice Terraces in the province of Ifugao. This is supposedly considered as the "Eighth Wonder of the World". Natural attractions of the region include the Sumaguing Cave in Sagada and the mummy caves of Benguet and Mt. Province. There are four National Parks: Cassamata Hill, Mount Pulag (the second highest mountain in the Philippines with an elevation of 2,922 meters above sea level), Mt. Data and Balbalasang-Balbalan, located in the province of Kalinga. Kalinga is also offering world class white water rafting along the chico river.


== History ==
On July 15, 1987, Executive Order No. 220 was issued creating the Cordillera Administrative Region. It is composed of provinces which used to be part of the Old Mountain Province. Republic Act No. 6766 was passed on October 23, 1989. It provided for an Organic Act for the Cordillera Autonomous Region. It mandates the creation of an autonomous government to be headed by a Regional Governor. It creates a Regional Assembly that will enact laws of regional application and a regional judiciary composed of a supreme court and lower courts. The act also directs the proposed autonomous government in the Cordillera to exercise governmental functions, including the raising of taxes, but excluding defense, foreign affairs and monetary functions. However, the Constitution requires that the act has to be ratified by the people in a plebiscite. It was originally scheduled on December 27 of the same year but was reset to January 30 the following by virtue of the Commission on Elections. During the said plebiscite, it was only Ifugao which voted favorably.
Republic Act No. 8438 dated December 22, 1997 created the Cordillera Autonomous Region. In January 1998, a group of lawyers challenged the constitutionality of the act. A plebiscite held on March 9 of the same year was held and invalidated the act. The region was created but reduced to a regular administrative region.

=== Ed walay pa ed saray Kastila ===
Mauswagong kabalayan na ang Sugbo mga tulo ka libo ka tuig kaniadto sa pa sakopa sa Espanya. Nakigbinayloay kini sa China ug uban pang kanasuran sa sidlakang-habagatang Asya.


=== Pag-abot so sakey Kastila ===
Miabot si Fernando de Magallanes sa Sugbo niadtong Abril 7, 1521. Gidawat sila isip mga dumuduong ni Radja Humabon nga kauban sa iyang asawa ug walo ka gatos nila ka sakop gipamunyagan sa mga Kachila niadtong Abril 14 isip mga unang Pilipinhong Katoliko. Apan pakyas hinuon si Magallano sa pag-ankon sa kapupud-ang Pilipinhon isip katigayonan sa hari sa Espanya sanglit napatay man siya ni Ka Lapulapu didto sa pulo sa Mactan pagka Abril 27 niadtong tuiga.
Abril 27, 1565, midunggo sa Sugbo si Miguel Lopez de Legazpi kuyog ang Agustinhong pareng si Andres de Urdaneta. Gisalid-an ni Legazpi ang ngalan sa dakbayan gikan sa San Miguel ngadto sa Villa del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus. Sulod sa unom ka tuig ang Sugbo maoy kaulohan sa bag-ong gitukod nga kolonya sa Espanya.
Gimugna ang lalawigan sa Sugbo ubos sa Act No. 2711 niadtong Marso 10, 1917. Mao kini ang natawhang lalawigan ni Sergio Osmeña, Sr. ang misunod pagkapangulo sa Commonwealth human ni Manuel L. Quezon panahon sa Ikaduhang Gubat sa Tibuok Kalibutan.
Ang lalawigan sa Sugbo ilabi na ang dakbayan sa Sugbo nakatagamtam og pagsaka sa international investments sa naunang bahin sa dekada 1990, diin namugna ang terminong CEBOOM isip tawag adtong pasakaha sa ekonomiya.
Giplanohang ipahigayon ang ASEAN Summit sa mga dakbayan sa Sugbu, Lapulapu, ug Mandaue niadtong 2006 apan tungod sa bagyong mihasi sa taliwalang Kapilipinhan gisibog ang maong panagtapok sa Enero 2007.


== Hiyograpiya ==
Ang Kan-irag Nature Park maoy parke sa baranggay sa Pung-ol Sibugay, sa mga bukiring parte sa dakbayan. Kini nag-abri tuig 2008, ug maoy parte usab sa Central Cebu Protected Landscape. Diri makit-an ang 100 ka eksotiko ug lumad nga espesye sa kahoy ug 27 ka espesye sa langgam.


== Listaan na Barangay ed Administrasiyon ==

Say siyudad na Cebú walay 80 ya barangay:


== Ekonomiya ==
Antes pa man mag-abot ang mga Katsilang kolonisador sa Pilipinas, usa na ka sentro sa komersyo sa kapupud-an ang Sugbo. Karon, kini ang sentrong pangkomersyo sa habagatan sa nasod, ug adunay duha ka distritong pampatigayon sa dakbayan: ang sukod sa Colon Street ug ang Cebu Business Park. Sa Lahug, makit-an usab ang Asiatown IT Park, usa ka deklaradong special economic zone.

== Relihiyon ==

Evangelized by the Agustinians between 1571 and 1580, Malolos formerly had its jurisdiction in Quingua—now Plaridel—from 1590–1602 and Paombong from 1580-1619. During this period,Malolos was an Encomienda until it was created as a civil town.The First Church was located in the Brgy Canalate near the river, but due to the frequent high tides that submerged the area, the friars moved the church to its present location in Poblacion in 1590. The majority of the residents are Christians. Roman Catholic is the predominant religion in the City.
Since the Spanish Period, Christianity, particularly Roman Catholicism faith in Malolos is very intensive. It is evident of the existence of the 3 big stone churches. Until now, Catholic faith in Malolos is still unwavering.
Being a dominant Catholic, Malolos together with the whole province of Bulacan is formerly annexed to the Archdiocese of Manila until March 11, 1962 when Pope John XXIII erected the Diocese of Malolos making the Malolos Church as its Cathedral.On March 2012 the Diocese of Malolos will celebrate its 50th Golden Jubilee with slogan "Biyaya at Pananampalataya" Fifty Years of Transforming Grace and Unwavering Faith.The Highlight of the celebration is the Canonical Coronation of the patroness and queen of the City and the whole Diocese,Virgen Inmaculada Concepcion de Malolos enshrined at the cathedral's altar.
Other religious groups include the Methodists, Aglipayans, Adventists, Baptists, Mormons, other Protestant churhes, and Nontrinitarian churches (like Members Church of God International, Iglesia ni Cristo, and Jehovah's Witness). There also some Evangelical, Pentecostal, Charismatic churhes, ministries, fellowships and religious groups. Islam (Muslims) could also be found in the city.

Say Dagupan City (salitan Pangasinan: Siyudad na Dagupan) sakey 3rd class siyudad ed luyag na Pangasinan, Filipinas. Onong ed 2000 census, walay population to ya 130,328 ya too diad 25,921 ya pamilya. According to the same survey, Pangasinan is the most populous province in the Philippines. Located on Lingayen Gulf on the island of Luzon, Dagupan is the chief port and commercial and financial center of the province and Northern Luzon; an active trade is conducted in sugarcane, corn, rice, copra, salt, and an alcoholic liquor produced from the nipa palm. The city is known as the Bangus (milkfish) capital of the Philippines because of its abundance of fresh bangus.
The longest barbecue measured 1,007.56 m (3,305.64 ft) - it was created by the people of Dagupan City on May 3, 2003 as part of the city’s Bangus Festival.


== Geography ==


== History ==


=== Pre-Hispanic times ===
Pangasinan in the 16th century, they found that Lingayen Gulf was already a prosperous entrepot visited by traders from other Asian countries. The Augustinian missionary Juan de la Concepcion noted that the communities at Lingayen, Bolinao and the defunct Binalatongan exercised authority over other communities (called baley in the Pangasinan language) in the area. De la Concepcion also mentioned several other towns but did not identify them.


=== Spanish colonial period ===
The area that is now known as Dagupan was described as marshland thickly covered with mangrove and nipa palm trees. The natives lived along the shoreline and riverbanks of Calmay, Pantal, and Bonuan. But there were also communities in Malaued, Lasip, Pogo, and Bacayao. The natives called the area Bacnotan which would later be incorporated into the encomienda of Lingayen that was established in 1583.
The foreign traders would come to the Lingayen coast to trade gold that was brought down to the area by tribesmen in the Cordillera Mountains. Aside from traders, Filipinos also had experience with pirates from Japan and China. One of the Chinese corsairs was Lim Feng (in Fukienese, Lim A-hong), who would be known in Philippine history as Limahong.
Limahong sailed down the Ilocos coast with 62 ships and attacked Manila on Nov. 30, 1574. The Spanish, however, repulsed Limahong's two attacks. The Chinese corsair repaired to Pangasinan to establish a colony at Bacnotan on December 2, 1574. But the Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo laid siege on his fortress for eight months by blocking the river outlets. Limahong puportedly broke through the siege by digging a channel from the Agno River through the Bacnotan marshes to Lingayen Gulf
In 1661, a big fire hit Bacnotan during the Malong Revolt, led by Andres Malong of Binalatongan, against the forced labor and mandatory sale of local goods imposed by the Spanish colonial government. The fire broke out after Malong sent 3,000 supporters, most of whom were Zambal tribesmen, to Ilocos and Cagayan to fight the Spaniards. The people of Bacnotan, many of whom joined the Spanish in repelling the Zambal marauders, rebuilt the town and renamed it Nandaragupan, meaning where once stood the commercial center, indicating its early importance as a trade, commercial and political center in the region. In 1720, Nandaragupan was chartered as a town but its name was simplified to Dagupan. Malong was eventually beheaded in the city's Pantal bridge in 1661 by Spanish authorities.
Dagupan was also the birthplace of a ladino named Caragay who led another uprising in 1719 against the provincial governor (alcalde mayor, in Spanish) who had him flogged for what appeared to be a false accusation of smuggling. Governor Antonio del Valle had Caragay arrested in the village of Nantagalan, northeast of San Jacinto and Mangaldan and flogged. Vowing vengeance, Caragay organized a band of men who hounded the governor until they were able to kill him. Historians view Caragay as a "model" of the revolts of Palaris and Diego Silang. More than Malong, historians view Caragay as a "model" of the revolts of Palaris and Diego Silang. In 1762, Dagupan would be one of the first towns to join the Palaris Revolt against Spain.
In 1780, Pantal, originally named Pantalan (port), became a trading center and docking station for merchant ships. At about the same time, the bangus industry thrived and mangrove swamps were converted into fishponds, starting the land conversions that would later have an impact on flooding and earthquake damage in the province. The opening of the Pantalan dock eased the transportation of goods from Pangasinan to other parts of the country, spurring the cultivation of idle lands in the eastern part and the development of fishponds in the western part of the province. The new dock also eased communications between the colonial government, its soldiers and the missionaries, who were tasked to colonize the natives in the Cordillera Mountains and the Cagayan Valley region and exploit its gold deposits.
In July 1787, the Spanish began to build a road to connect Pangasinan and the Cagayan Valley, the home of several head-hunting tribesmen who refused to submit to Spanish rule. Although it took several years to complete, the road would play a vital role in the colonization of the Cagayan Valley and the Cordillera Mountains.
The Palaris and Silang revolts, which occurred simultaneously with the British Invasion of the Philippines demonstrated to the Spaniards the importance of ports in Pangasin and Ilocos to the security of the entire island of Luzon. They thus became centers of Spanish governance and acculturation in the 19th century. When the port of Manila was opened to foreign trade in 1830, tobacco from Pangasinan and Cagayan Valley were shipped to the colonial capital via Dagupan and Lingayen. Foreign trading agents also began to make appearances in the two towns, starting a new era of prosperity, especially for the provincial gentry.
The Filipino scholar Maximo Kalaw found the description of the American writer David Barrows as appropriate:
The Filipino had now become embarked upon a new current of intellectual experience -- a course of enlightenment which has been so full of unexpected development... Throughout the islands a class was rapidly growing up to which the new industries had brought wealth. Their means enabled them to build spacious and splendid homes of the fine hardwoods of the Philippines, and to surround themselves with such luxuries as the life of the islands permitted. This class was rapidly gaining education.
This was also true of the Dagupan gentry. Trade enriched many families and allowed them to send their scions to study overseas. These young men returned to the Philippines not only with technical knowledge in their chosen fields but also with the intellectual currents of the time, including constitutional republicanism which swept Spain in 1810.
News from the colonial government in Manila also reached Dagupan at a faster pace with the completion of the Manila-Dagupan Railway in 1891. The railway would play a significant role not only in the economic development of Pangasinan but also in the success of the Philippine Revolution.


=== Under the First Philippine Republic ===
Not much is known of Dagupeños involvement in the Katipunan and the first and second parts of the Philippine Revolution. But on Mar. 7, 1898, the Dagupeños unveiled a coordinated attack on Spanish forces that appears to have been planned months in advance. It is now known as the Battle of Dagupan (1898)
The Dagupeño leaders of the attack were Juan Solis Galvan, Teodoro Villamil, Pedro de Venecia, Macario Meneses and Daniel Maramba. They were under the overall command of Francisco Macabulos, who had just liberated the provinces of Pampanga and Tarlac. He was assisted by Ramon Manalang, who was based in Alaminos. Communications between Macabulos and Manalang was coordinated by Macario Meneses of Bonuan.
The Spanish forces were commanded by Federico Caballos, who had troops garrisoned at all the towns of Pangasinan. In Dagupan, he had men at the Colegio de San Alberto Magno, which guarded the western approach to the town; at the foot of Quintos Bridge, which guarded the east; and his main force at the Catholic Church.
Although the revolutionary forces were ill equipped (most of them armed only with bolos and lances), they attacked the Spanish with an ingenious rolling trench. The "trenches" were made of several banana tree trunks, wrapped in sheets of dried nipa palm leaves. The trenches were seven feet in diameter and the revolutionists would roll the it toward Spanish positions so they could fight them in close quarter with their bolos and lances.
Galvan led the back at the Colegio de San Alberto Magno while Villamil and De Venecia swooped down on the enemies at Quintos Bridge. The Tagalog forces from Nueva Ecija, who were better armed, joined the Dagupeños who attacked the Spanish position at the church. The Dagupeños held the Spanish troops at bay in Dagupan while other revolutionists liberated other towns in the province. Maramba later joined the battle after fighting in Sta. Barbara and Mangaldan.
By July 21, after four months and 16 days, Macabulos unleashed a concerted attack. The Spanish and Filipino troops exchanged fire for two nights and a day before Caballos surrendered on July 23 1898, six weeks after the Declaration of Philippine Independence on June 12, 1898.
After the town returned to normal, President Emilio Aguinaldo named Galvan president of the municipal council. Galvan was a ranking officer of the Katipunan. Galvan Street along which the public market was built was named after him.


=== American colonial period ===
On January 8-9, 1945, U.S. General Douglas MacArthur landed his amphibious liberation force in the city's "Blue Beach" section along the Lingayen Gulf. From his beachhead in Dagupan, along with those in neighboring towns Lingayen and San Fabian, MacArthur's forces under General Walter Krueger were able to penetrate Japanese defenses in Luzon island and liberate Filipino and allied prisoners of war in Manila's University of Sto. Tomas.


=== Dagupan becomes a city ===
Dagupan became a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 170, authored by Speaker Eugenio Perez. It was signed into law by President Manuel Roxas on June 20, 1947.
On October 15, 1947, President Roxas issued Executive Order No. 96 fixing the city limits to include the towns of San Fabian, Pangasinan and Calasiao, Pangasinan but the residents of Calasiao rejected inclusion into the new city, causing controversy over the election that was held on Nov. 10, 1947.
The dispute was brought before the Supreme Court of the Philippines which subsequently validated the election and ruled that Dagupan became a city on June 20, 1947, when Roxas signed the charter into law.
Despite the controversy attending Dagupan's rise as a city, the new city mayor, Angel B. Fernandez, embarked on an infrastructure program that would develop erswhile idle swamplands toward the south and west.
In 1948, he built a road from barrio Mayombo to barrio Tapuac, passing through the edge of barrio Pogo Chico. The road, built mostly on reclaimed swampland, was named Perez Boulevard, in honor of Dagupan's first lawyer and Assemblyman Rodrigo Perez. The road was needed because of the increasing number of commercial establishments on Torres Bugallon Avenue and the growing number of residents at the southern limits of the city. In 1946, the Dagupan City High School was transferred from Torres Bugallon Avenue. Perez Boulevard expanded the commercial area south especially after Fernandez built a new public market at the bank of the river.
Later, Fernandez's successor Teofilo Guadiz, who served from 1954-1957 and 1958-1959, would also contribute to the city's expansion by extending Rizal Street, which was only then from Torres Bugallon to Rivera Street, up to the Iglesia ni Cristo compound. Also, he extended Galvan Street, which was then up to Gomez Street only, up to Perez Boulevard. He also secured funds from Senator Cipriano P. Primicias Sr., a native of Pangasinan, to build a two-story semi-permanent building for the city high school. Guadiz also replaced the Bailey bridge on Perez Boulevard with a concrete one.
The westward expansion of the city went as far as Lucao which was also swampland. Local historian Restituto Basa surmised that the name Lucao may have been derived from the shellfish called lukan that used to abound in the swampy area.
In June 1962, Dagupan was shaken by a series of strong earthquakes which occurred at irregular intervals for about three weeks. The quakes toppled the belfry of the Roman Catholic Church. The epicenter of the earthquake was in Calmay, where real estate values dropped after the temblors. Many people from Calmay, Carael and island barrios evacuated to other towns.
In 1968, the national government agencies opened offices in Dagupan and other key cities across the country. The daytime population increased sustantially, causing congestion in the city that began to see the appearance of public utility tricycles.
On July 16, 1990, an magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck northern Luzon. The worst hit cities were Cabanatuan, Baguio and Dagupan.
Many public and private structures were destroyed or damaged when river banks slid into the Pantal River and dry land into the swampy areas. Streets were ruptured and the ground subsided, causing buildings to sink by as much as two meters. Other buildings tilted severely, especially along Perez Boulevard. One building tilted by as much as 19 degrees, but generally, the magnitude of tilt was within 2-5 degrees.
There were sand boils in several areas in the city and drainage systems were clogged by the accumulated sand causing temporary flooding of the city's main thoroughfares. Some houses remained underwater by 30-50 cms. for several months. The whole stretch of Don Jose Calimlim Street and swampy areas and fishpond communities, such as Barangay Lasip Grande, remained underwater even during low tide conditions.

At the height of the earthquake, an eyewitness told experts of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology that he saw rolling during the earthquake and a jeep parked along the road vanished from his sight.
Scientists blamed the destruction on the liquefaction of land that was had not compacted enough since it was reclaimed from the swamp or marsh. It was also blamed on the active shifting of Pantal River, which left abandoned meanders on which people built structures. Varying degrees of damage were sustained in the different affected areas of Dagupan City. Phivolcs said a study of the damage during the earthquake indicate that susceptibility to liquefaction in different parts of Dagupan City can be related to the relative ages of the geologic features and the deposits underlying them.
The degree of destruction along A.B. Fernandez Avenue, which largely lies on reclaimed swampland, was generally less than that in the Perez Blvd. area except near its intersection with Rizal Street. The great degree of liquefaction along a 100m stretch of A.B. Fernandez Ave. can be traced to changes in the channel of Pantal River. Prior to north eastward expansion of Dagupan City, Pantal River used to meander around the area now partly occupied by A.B. Fernandez Ave. and Rizal St. before running parallel to Pantal Road.

Say Las Piñas sakey siyudad diad Pilipino ed Metro Manila.


== Say siyudad ==
Since its establishment as a small fishing port and a major salt-making center during the Spanish Era, Las Piñas has grown into an important residential, commercial and industrial suburb of Metro Manila.
Las Piñas is famous for its Bamboo Organ, located inside the St. Joseph Church of the Parish of Las Piñas, formerly known as San Jose Parish Church in the Spanish Period, as the only organ of its kind in the world. Built in 1824 by Catholic priest, Fr. Diego Cera, created out of bamboo, wood, and metal, this famous organ is praised for its unique, rare, and melodious sound.
The Sarao Motors factory is also located in Las Piñas, the place where Jeepneys are assembled piece by piece in painstaking individual production. The factory remains open to buyers and curious visitors all year round.
Las Piñas has a large shopping mall named SM Southmall, which has an area of 205,120 square meters and is located along Alabang–Zapote Road. The newest shopping mall development in the city is SM Center Las Piñas, located few meters away from the City Hall. The first high rise building in the city is 16 story residential building Almanza Metropolis.
Las Piñas, also known as one of the cleanest cities in Metro Manila, is in the list of the "Clean and Green Hall of Fame" awarded by the Philippine Government. It is also the first local government unit in the Philippines that has been honored with the prestigious Global 500 Roll of Honour of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). These honors were in recognition of the city's outstanding achievements in the protection and improvement of the environment.
Las Piñas has recently acquired the status "Most Competitive City" in the Philippines, together with Davao City, Sekano (Makati), Muntinlupa and Marikina.


== Historiya ==
Las Piñas was one of the earliest fishing settlements on the shores of Manila Bay and was proclaimed a town either in 1762 or 1797. Its exact date of creation cannot be ascertained because historical records vary. Cavada, a Spanish historian and Fr. Juan Medina placed it at 1762, while Buzeta recorded the date at 1797.
Besides being famous for its Bamboo Organ, which was built by Fr. Diego Cera and completed in 1824, the town of Las Piñas was also a major war theater during the 1896 Philippine Revolution, as it was occupied by Gen. Emilio Aquinaldo's forces. Las Piñas was also, occupied by the Japanese during Second World War, to be followed by the liberation period, when the combined Filipino and American forces fought the Japanese Imperial armed forces until the end of war.
In 1901, the Municipality of Las Piñas was incorporated from Cavite to the newly created province of Rizal pursuant to Philippine Commission Act No. 137. Two years later, it was combined with Parañaque, the latter being the seat of a new municipal government.
It became a separate municipality from Parañaque on March 27, 1907 by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 1625. Then, with the founding of the Metropolitan Manila Area (Metro Manila in short) in 1976, Las Piñas became one of the municipalities making up the region.
On February 12, 1997, President Fidel Ramos signed the bill declaring Las Piñas a new city. A plebiscite held a month after found the residents in approval of cityhood and Las Piñas became the 10th city of Metro Manila on March 26, 1997.


== Gobiyerno ==
Las Piñas, like other cities of the Philippines, is a local government unit whose powers and functions are specified by the Local Government Code of the Philippines. In general, as a city, Las Piñas is headed by a mayor who heads the city's executive function and the vice mayor who heads the city's legislative function, which is composed of twelve councilors, six each from the city's two city council districts. For representation, the city is considered as one district, and therefore one representative, in the country's House of Representatives.
Additionally, like other cities and municipalities, Las Piñas is subdivided into barangays.

Sagor na Baybay na Luzon Region (Northwestern Luzon Region) or Region 1 of the Philippines is located in the northwestern part of Luzon. It is bounded by Cordillera Administrative Region and Cagayan Valley to the east, Central Luzon to the south and by the South China Sea to the west.
The region is composed of four provinces, namely: Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union and Pangasinan. Its regional center is San Fernando City, La Union. The region is occupied 70% by Ilocanos and 28% by Pangasinenses.
Although the Philippine government designated Region 1 as the Ilocos Region, many people find the designated name of the region as ethno-centric. Many people find the name Northwestern Region, which is geographically deduced, as the more appropriate term.


== People and culture ==
The Ilocos provinces of Region 1 is the historical homeland of the Ilocanos. The Ilocanos have the following percentage of the population inside the bracket in each province: Pangasinan (43%), La Union (92%), Ilocos Norte (97%), and Ilocos Sur (93%). Pangasinan is the historical homeland of the Pangasinenses. The population of Pangasinan composed around 60% of the whole population of the region. The Pangasinenses presently constitute around 50% of the population of the province. The province was not originally part of the Region 1. It was only during the time of President Marcos, when Pangasinan was included in the province. Minority groups include the Tingguian and Isneg communities that inhabit the foothills of the Cordillera mountains.
The population is predominantly Roman Catholic with strong adherents of Protestantism such as the Aglipayan denomination further north of the country. There is also an undercurrent of traditional animistic beliefs especially in rural areas. The small mercantile Chinese and Indian communities are primarily Buddhists and Hindus respectively


== Economy ==
Although the economy in the southern portion of the region, esp. Pangasinan, is anchored in agro-industial and service industry, the economy in the northern portion of the region is anchored in the agricultural sector. The economy in Pangasinan is driven by agro-industrial businesses, such as milkfish (bangus) cultivation and processing, livestock raising, fish paste processing (bagoong), and others. At the same time the importance of trading, financial services, and educational services in the economy cannot be denied. Income in the northern portion mostly come from cultivating rice, tobacco, corn, sugarcane, and fruits; raising livestock such as pigs, chicken, goats, and carabaos (water buffalos).
The distribution of the economic activity in the region may be seen from the collection of tax revenue of the national government. According to the data from the Statistical Coordination Board, the bulk of the collections come from Pangasinan, which posted 61% of the total.
The service and light manufacturing industries are concentrated in the cities. Dagupan City is mostly driven by its local entrepreneurs, which have started to expand its network up to the national level. San Fernando City in La Union also has an active shipping port and Laoag City in Ilocos Norte has a growing international airport. The government is one of the largest employers along with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola.
The tourism industry focuses on the coastal beaches and on eco-tourism. There are fine sands stretching along Bauang, La Union and the rest of the region. Opportunities to engage in other water sports and activities abound. Eco-tourism takes advantage of the marine and forest resources in the region and displays the natural beauty of the Ilocos.
The region is also rich in crafts, with renowned blanket-weaving and pottery. Their burnay pottery is well known for its dark colored clay.


== Political Division ==
Region 1 is composed of 4 provinces and a total of 9 cities.


==== Component Cities ====
Alaminos City, Pangasinan
Siyudad na Candon, Ilocos Sur
Dagupan City , Pangasinan
Laoag City, Ilocos Norte
Urdaneta City, Pangasinan
Siyudad na San Carlos, Pangasinan
Siyudad na San Fernando, La Union
Siyudad na Vigan, Ilocos Sur


=== Physical ===
Region 1 occupies the narrow plain between the Cordillera Central mountain range and the South China Sea. It also occupies the northern portion of the Central Luzon plain, to the northeast of the Zambales Mountains.
Lingayen Gulf is the most notable body of water in the region and it contains a number of islands, including the Hundred Islands National Park. To the north of the region is Luzon Strait.
The Agno river runs through Pangasinan and empties into Lingayen Gulf. The river flow into a broad delta in the vicinity of Lingayen and Dagupan City.


== Tourist Attractions ==
Hundred Islands National Park. Located in the Lingayen Gulf in Pangasinan, the watery park is dotted by 123 small, pristine islands. Three islands have been developed for tourists.
Vigan colonial houses. Vigan City is famous for its cobblestone streets and Spanish-style houses, an architectural remnant of its colonial past. The Mestizo District displays mansions typical of the era. They were owned by prominent Ilocano-Chinese merchant families of that time, hence mestizo or "mixed race."
Ancient churches. The region is dotted by old Catholic churches built by natives for the Spanish. Famous churches can be found in Vigan City, once the seat of the Bishop of Nueva Segovia, and in Manaoag, Pangasinan.


== History ==
Region 1 was first inhabited by the aboriginal Negritos before they were pushed by successive waves of Malay immigrants that penetrated the narrow coast. Tingguians in the interior, Ilocanos in the north, and Pangasinense in the south settled the region.
The Spanish arrived in the 16th century and established Christian missions and governmental institutions to control the native population and convert them to the Roman Catholic church. Present-day Vigan City in Ilocos Sur province became the bishopric seat of Nueva Segovia. Proud Ilocanos in the northern parts were less easily swayed, however, and remained an area filled with deep resentments against Spain. These resentments bubbled to the surface at various points in the region's history as insurrections. According to Nick Joaquin in his book Culture and History, the Pangasinenses were the last to be stand against the Spaniards.
The most notable of the rebellions were that of Andres Malong and Palaris of Pangasinan,Diego Silang and his wife Gabriela Silang in 1764, and the Basi Revolt in the 19th century.
In 1901, the region went under American colonial rule, and in 1941, under Japanese occupation.
Several modern presidents of the Republic of the Philippines hailed from the Region: Elpidio Quirino, Ferdinand Marcos, and Fidel Ramos.
Before the Cordillera Administrative Region was formed, Region 1 also included the provinces of Abra, Mountain Province, and Benguet.Ipatalos yo pa ya ed salitan Pangasinan. Sarag yon dagdagan o bawasan. Salamat.

Located on Lingayen Gulf on the island of Luzon, Dagupan is the chief port and commercial and financial center of the province and Northern Luzon; an active trade is conducted in sugarcane, corn, rice, copra, salt, and an alcoholic liquor produced from the nipa palm. The city is known as the Bangus (milkfish) capital of the Philippines because of its abundance of fresh bangus.
The longest barbecue measured 1,007.56 m (3,305.64 ft) - it was created by the people of Dagupan City on May 3, 2003 as part of the city’s Bangus Festival.


== Geography ==


== History ==


=== Pre-Hispanic times ===
Pangasinan in the 16th century, they found that Lingayen Gulf was already a prosperous entrepot visited by traders from other Asian countries. The Augustinian missionary Juan de la Concepcion noted that the communities at Lingayen, Bolinao and the defunct Binalatongan exercised authority over other communities (called baley in the Pangasinan language) in the area. De la Concepcion also mentioned several other towns but did not identify them.


=== Spanish colonial period ===
The area that is now known as Dagupan was described as marshland thickly covered with mangrove and nipa palm trees. The natives lived along the shoreline and riverbanks of Calmay, Pantal, and Bonuan. But there were also communities in Malaued, Lasip, Pogo, and Bacayao. The natives called the area Bacnotan which would later be incorporated into the encomienda of Lingayen that was established in 1583.
The foreign traders would come to the Lingayen coast to trade gold that was brought down to the area by tribesmen in the Cordillera Mountains. Aside from traders, Filipinos also had experience with pirates from Japan and China. One of the Chinese corsairs was Lim Feng (in Fukienese, Lim A-hong), who would be known in Philippine history as Limahong.
Limahong sailed down the Ilocos coast with 62 ships and attacked Manila on Nov. 30, 1574. The Spanish, however, repulsed Limahong's two attacks. The Chinese corsair repaired to Pangasinan to establish a colony at Bacnotan on December 2, 1574. But the Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo laid siege on his fortress for eight months by blocking the river outlets. Limahong puportedly broke through the siege by digging a channel from the Agno River through the Bacnotan marshes to Lingayen Gulf
In 1661, a big fire hit Bacnotan during the Malong Revolt, led by Andres Malong of Binalatongan, against the forced labor and mandatory sale of local goods imposed by the Spanish colonial government. The fire broke out after Malong sent 3,000 supporters, most of whom were Zambal tribesmen, to Ilocos and Cagayan to fight the Spaniards. The people of Bacnotan, many of whom joined the Spanish in repelling the Zambal marauders, rebuilt the town and renamed it Nandaragupan, meaning where once stood the commercial center, indicating its early importance as a trade, commercial and political center in the region. In 1720, Nandaragupan was chartered as a town but its name was simplified to Dagupan. Malong was eventually beheaded in the city's Pantal bridge in 1661 by Spanish authorities.
Dagupan was also the birthplace of a ladino named Caragay who led another uprising in 1719 against the provincial governor (alcalde mayor, in Spanish) who had him flogged for what appeared to be a false accusation of smuggling. Governor Antonio del Valle had Caragay arrested in the village of Nantagalan, northeast of San Jacinto and Mangaldan and flogged. Vowing vengeance, Caragay organized a band of men who hounded the governor until they were able to kill him. Historians view Caragay as a "model" of the revolts of Palaris and Diego Silang. More than Malong, historians view Caragay as a "model" of the revolts of Palaris and Diego Silang. In 1762, Dagupan would be one of the first towns to join the Palaris Revolt against Spain.
In 1780, Pantal, originally named Pantalan (port), became a trading center and docking station for merchant ships. At about the same time, the bangus industry thrived and mangrove swamps were converted into fishponds, starting the land conversions that would later have an impact on flooding and earthquake damage in the province. The opening of the Pantalan dock eased the transportation of goods from Pangasinan to other parts of the country, spurring the cultivation of idle lands in the eastern part and the development of fishponds in the western part of the province. The new dock also eased communications between the colonial government, its soldiers and the missionaries, who were tasked to colonize the natives in the Cordillera Mountains and the Cagayan Valley region and exploit its gold deposits.
In July 1787, the Spanish began to build a road to connect Pangasinan and the Cagayan Valley, the home of several head-hunting tribesmen who refused to submit to Spanish rule. Although it took several years to complete, the road would play a vital role in the colonization of the Cagayan Valley and the Cordillera Mountains.
The Palaris and Silang revolts, which occurred simultaneously with the British Invasion of the Philippines demonstrated to the Spaniards the importance of ports in Pangasin and Ilocos to the security of the entire island of Luzon. They thus became centers of Spanish governance and acculturation in the 19th century. When the port of Manila was opened to foreign trade in 1830, tobacco from Pangasinan and Cagayan Valley were shipped to the colonial capital via Dagupan and Lingayen. Foreign trading agents also began to make appearances in the two towns, starting a new era of prosperity, especially for the provincial gentry.
The Filipino scholar Maximo Kalaw found the description of the American writer David Barrows as appropriate:
The Filipino had now become embarked upon a new current of intellectual experience -- a course of enlightenment which has been so full of unexpected development... Throughout the islands a class was rapidly growing up to which the new industries had brought wealth. Their means enabled them to build spacious and splendid homes of the fine hardwoods of the Philippines, and to surround themselves with such luxuries as the life of the islands permitted. This class was rapidly gaining education.
This was also true of the Dagupan gentry. Trade enriched many families and allowed them to send their scions to study overseas. These young men returned to the Philippines not only with technical knowledge in their chosen fields but also with the intellectual currents of the time, including constitutional republicanism which swept Spain in 1810.
News from the colonial government in Manila also reached Dagupan at a faster pace with the completion of the Manila-Dagupan Railway in 1891. The railway would play a significant role not only in the economic development of Pangasinan but also in the success of the Philippine Revolution.


=== Under the First Philippine Republic ===
Not much is known of Dagupeños involvement in the Katipunan and the first and second parts of the Philippine Revolution. But on Mar. 7, 1898, the Dagupeños unveiled a coordinated attack on Spanish forces that appears to have been planned months in advance. It is now known as the Battle of Dagupan (1898)
The Dagupeño leaders of the attack were Juan Solis Galvan, Teodoro Villamil, Pedro de Venecia, Macario Meneses and Daniel Maramba. They were under the overall command of Francisco Macabulos, who had just liberated the provinces of Pampanga and Tarlac. He was assisted by Ramon Manalang, who was based in Alaminos. Communications between Macabulos and Manalang was coordinated by Macario Meneses of Bonuan.
The Spanish forces were commanded by Federico Caballos, who had troops garrisoned at all the towns of Pangasinan. In Dagupan, he had men at the Colegio de San Alberto Magno, which guarded the western approach to the town; at the foot of Quintos Bridge, which guarded the east; and his main force at the Catholic Church.
Although the revolutionary forces were ill equipped (most of them armed only with bolos and lances), they attacked the Spanish with an ingenious rolling trench. The "trenches" were made of several banana tree trunks, wrapped in sheets of dried nipa palm leaves. The trenches were seven feet in diameter and the revolutionists would roll the it toward Spanish positions so they could fight them in close quarter with their bolos and lances.
Galvan led the back at the Colegio de San Alberto Magno while Villamil and De Venecia swooped down on the enemies at Quintos Bridge. The Tagalog forces from Nueva Ecija, who were better armed, joined the Dagupeños who attacked the Spanish position at the church. The Dagupeños held the Spanish troops at bay in Dagupan while other revolutionists liberated other towns in the province. Maramba later joined the battle after fighting in Sta. Barbara and Mangaldan.
By July 21, after four months and 16 days, Macabulos unleashed a concerted attack. The Spanish and Filipino troops exchanged fire for two nights and a day before Caballos surrendered on July 23 1898, six weeks after the Declaration of Philippine Independence on June 12, 1898.
After the town returned to normal, President Emilio Aguinaldo named Galvan president of the municipal council. Galvan was a ranking officer of the Katipunan. Galvan Street along which the public market was built was named after him.


=== American colonial period ===
On January 8-9, 1945, U.S. General Douglas MacArthur landed his amphibious liberation force in the city's "Blue Beach" section along the Lingayen Gulf. From his beachhead in Dagupan, along with those in neighboring towns Lingayen and San Fabian, MacArthur's forces under General Walter Krueger were able to penetrate Japanese defenses in Luzon island and liberate Filipino and allied prisoners of war in Manila's University of Sto. Tomas.


=== Dagupan becomes a city ===
Dagupan became a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 170, authored by Speaker Eugenio Perez. It was signed into law by President Manuel Roxas on June 20, 1947.
On October 15, 1947, President Roxas issued Executive Order No. 96 fixing the city limits to include the towns of San Fabian, Pangasinan and Calasiao, Pangasinan but the residents of Calasiao rejected inclusion into the new city, causing controversy over the election that was held on Nov. 10, 1947.
The dispute was brought before the Supreme Court of the Philippines which subsequently validated the election and ruled that Dagupan became a city on June 20, 1947, when Roxas signed the charter into law.
Despite the controversy attending Dagupan's rise as a city, the new city mayor, Angel B. Fernandez, embarked on an infrastructure program that would develop erswhile idle swamplands toward the south and west.
In 1948, he built a road from barrio Mayombo to barrio Tapuac, passing through the edge of barrio Pogo Chico. The road, built mostly on reclaimed swampland, was named Perez Boulevard, in honor of Dagupan's first lawyer and Assemblyman Rodrigo Perez. The road was needed because of the increasing number of commercial establishments on Torres Bugallon Avenue and the growing number of residents at the southern limits of the city. In 1946, the Dagupan City High School was transferred from Torres Bugallon Avenue. Perez Boulevard expanded the commercial area south especially after Fernandez built a new public market at the bank of the river.
Later, Fernandez's successor Teofilo Guadiz, who served from 1954-1957 and 1958-1959, would also contribute to the city's expansion by extending Rizal Street, which was only then from Torres Bugallon to Rivera Street, up to the Iglesia ni Cristo compound. Also, he extended Galvan Street, which was then up to Gomez Street only, up to Perez Boulevard. He also secured funds from Senator Cipriano P. Primicias Sr., a native of Pangasinan, to build a two-story semi-permanent building for the city high school. Guadiz also replaced the Bailey bridge on Perez Boulevard with a concrete one.
The westward expansion of the city went as far as Lucao which was also swampland. Local historian Restituto Basa surmised that the name Lucao may have been derived from the shellfish called lukan that used to abound in the swampy area.
In June 1962, Dagupan was shaken by a series of strong earthquakes which occurred at irregular intervals for about three weeks. The quakes toppled the belfry of the Roman Catholic Church. The epicenter of the earthquake was in Calmay, where real estate values dropped after the temblors. Many people from Calmay, Carael and island barrios evacuated to other towns.
In 1968, the national government agencies opened offices in Dagupan and other key cities across the country. The daytime population increased sustantially, causing congestion in the city that began to see the appearance of public utility tricycles.
On July 16, 1990, an magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck northern Luzon. The worst hit cities were Cabanatuan, Baguio and Dagupan.
Many public and private structures were destroyed or damaged when river banks slid into the Pantal River and dry land into the swampy areas. Streets were ruptured and the ground subsided, causing buildings to sink by as much as two meters. Other buildings tilted severely, especially along Perez Boulevard. One building tilted by as much as 19 degrees, but generally, the magnitude of tilt was within 2-5 degrees.
There were sand boils in several areas in the city and drainage systems were clogged by the accumulated sand causing temporary flooding of the city's main thoroughfares. Some houses remained underwater by 30-50 cms. for several months. The whole stretch of Don Jose Calimlim Street and swampy areas and fishpond communities, such as Barangay Lasip Grande, remained underwater even during low tide conditions.

At the height of the earthquake, an eyewitness told experts of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology that he saw rolling during the earthquake and a jeep parked along the road vanished from his sight.
Scientists blamed the destruction on the liquefaction of land that was had not compacted enough since it was reclaimed from the swamp or marsh. It was also blamed on the active shifting of Pantal River, which left abandoned meanders on which people built structures. Varying degrees of damage were sustained in the different affected areas of Dagupan City. Phivolcs said a study of the damage during the earthquake indicate that susceptibility to liquefaction in different parts of Dagupan City can be related to the relative ages of the geologic features and the deposits underlying them.
The degree of destruction along A.B. Fernandez Avenue, which largely lies on reclaimed swampland, was generally less than that in the Perez Blvd. area except near its intersection with Rizal Street. The great degree of liquefaction along a 100m stretch of A.B. Fernandez Ave. can be traced to changes in the channel of Pantal River. Prior to north eastward expansion of Dagupan City, Pantal River used to meander around the area now partly occupied by A.B. Fernandez Ave. and Rizal St. before running parallel to Pantal Road.

Baguio City is the regional center. The Cordillera region encompasses most of the areas within the Cordillera Central mountain range of Luzon, the largest range in the country. This region is home to numerous indigenous tribes collectively called the Igorot.
The Cordillera Administrative Region is the only landlocked region in the country.


== Economy ==
Cordillera has abundant mineral reserves. These include metallic ores such as gold, copper, silver, zinc, and non-metallic minerals like sand, gravel and sulfur. Mineral reserves are found in all the provinces. However, mining is concentrated in Benguet.


== Geography ==


=== Political Divisions ===
CAR is subdivided into 6 provinces and Baguio City.

¹ Baguio City is a highly urbanized city; figures are excluded from Benguet Province.


=== Physical ===
Almost the whole region is situated in the mountainous Cordillera Central range. Located there is Mount Pulag, the second highest mountain in the country, rising at 2,922 meters. Various rivers start here, like the Cagayan River and the Agno River.


== Tourist attractions ==
Tourist attractions in the region include the world famous Banaue Rice Terraces in the province of Ifugao. This is supposedly considered as the "Eighth Wonder of the World". Natural attractions of the region include the Sumaguing Cave in Sagada and the mummy caves of Benguet and Mt. Province. There are four National Parks: Cassamata Hill, Mount Pulag (the second highest mountain in the Philippines with an elevation of 2,922 meters above sea level), Mt. Data and Balbalasang-Balbalan, located in the province of Kalinga. Kalinga is also offering world class white water rafting along the chico river.


== History ==
On July 15, 1987, Executive Order No. 220 was issued creating the Cordillera Administrative Region. It is composed of provinces which used to be part of the Old Mountain Province. Republic Act No. 6766 was passed on October 23, 1989. It provided for an Organic Act for the Cordillera Autonomous Region. It mandates the creation of an autonomous government to be headed by a Regional Governor. It creates a Regional Assembly that will enact laws of regional application and a regional judiciary composed of a supreme court and lower courts. The act also directs the proposed autonomous government in the Cordillera to exercise governmental functions, including the raising of taxes, but excluding defense, foreign affairs and monetary functions. However, the Constitution requires that the act has to be ratified by the people in a plebiscite. It was originally scheduled on December 27 of the same year but was reset to January 30 the following by virtue of the Commission on Elections. During the said plebiscite, it was only Ifugao which voted favorably.
Republic Act No. 8438 dated December 22, 1997 created the Cordillera Autonomous Region. In January 1998, a group of lawyers challenged the constitutionality of the act. A plebiscite held on March 9 of the same year was held and invalidated the act. The region was created but reduced to a regular administrative region.Ipatalos yo pa ya ed salitan Pangasinan.

== Historiya ==
The town had its humble beginnings in 1770 as a farming village when it was founded by Don Mariano del Pilar de los Reyes and named it Barrio Del Pilar. It was in a productive agricultural area between the towns of San Luis in the North and Apalit in the South. As the population kept on growing in the local community, the leading citizens of the progressive village initiated a petition to consolidate a portion of the southern part of the town of San Luis and a land area from the northern part of the municipality of Apalit to form an independent municipality.
Appraised of the economic potential of a new town and confidence in the management capability of the leaders, the Spanish Governor General at the time during his second term as chief administrator of the Philippines, Don Simón de Anda y Salazar approved the official creation of the town on November 15, 1771.
The town was named in honor of the Spanish Governor General who approved its creation and of the Apostle Simon Peter, the Patron Saint of the illustrious town of Apalit. Like any other typical Spanish town (pueblo) it was administered by a “Capitan del Pueblo” and had a municipal policy making body called today as Municipal Council. The Catholic Parish Church, the Public Market, the Town Plaza and homes of prominent families were located within the proximity of the Municipal Hall. The people of San Simon celebrate two town fiestas, one in honor of Lady of the Pillar, the patron saint of the first barrio and the other in honor of the Apostle Simon Peter. In 1898, the retreating military forces of General Antonio Luna on their way to Nueva Ecija burned the parish church.
Among the early settlers of the town were the de los Reyes, de los Santos, Macapagal, Pangan, Punzalan, Puyat, Santos and Simbulan families.
In 1904, the town of San Simon was merged with the municipality of San Luis and about three years after, it became again an independent municipality. In 1920, the geographical boundaries of San Luis, Apalit and San Simon were officially established.
In 1979, through the effort and financial contributions of the Ibanez, Guevarra, Santos, Punsalan, Pangan and other families, the church was rebuilt and named as Nuestra Senora Del Pilar.


== Saray politika tan gobiyerno ==
Like other towns in the Philippines, San Simon is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head and leads the town's departments in executing the ordinances and improving public services. The vice mayor heads a legislative council (Sangguniang Bayan) consisting of councilors from the Barangays of Barrios.


=== Municipal Government ===
Just as the national government, the municipal government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative and judiciary. The judicial branch is administered solely by the Supreme Court of the Philippines. The LGUs have control of the executive and legislative branch.
The executive branch is composed of the governor for the provinces, mayor for the cities and municipalities, and the barangay captain for the barangays.Local Government Code of the Philippines, Book III, Department of Interior and Local Government official website. The legislative branch is composed of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (provincial assembly) for the provinces, Sangguniang Panlungsod (city assembly) for the cities, Sangguniang Bayan (town assembly) for the municipalities, Sangguniang Barangay (barangay council), and the Sangguniang Kabataan for the youth sector.
The seat of Government is vested upon the Mayor and other elected officers who hold office at the Town hall. The Sanguniang Bayan is the center of legislation.


=== Tanod ed Ehekutibo ===
Available records at the Municipal Hall list the following town executives from 1898 until present:


== Ekonomiya ==
The principal industries in San Simon are farming, fishing and poultry and swine industries. There are two public markets in San Simon, one in the old poblacion area and another one located in the industrial zone area.
Following the advancement of technology and industrialization, the climate for investment in San Simon is very promising because of its geographic location and the incentives initiated by Mayor Manuel S. Bondoc and the Municipal Council presided then by Vice Mayor Azor L. Sitchon. Through their effort and efficient leadership, the town with an annual gross income of about 500,000.00 Philippine pesos in 1988 as a 6th class municipality became a 4th class municipality with an annual gross income of more than 3,500,000 Philippine pesos by the end of the 20th century. When Mayor Azor L. Sitchon, an Economics graduate with honors from the famed Ateneo de Manila University took over the administration as elected mayor, he not only continued the completion of the projects and programs of his predecessor, Mayor Manuel S. Bondoc but he also initiated his own new economic programs and infrastructure projects including a modern public market and a new Municipal Hall along the national highway in barrio San Agustin (Tulauc) and made it centrally accessible from all directions. Barrio San Agustin (Tulauc) became a commercial center and the seat of municipal government, thus contributing to the increase of municipal tax revenues. Total target tax revenues from business taxes, real property taxes and other fees were projected to be more than 7,000,000.00 Philippine pesos. It is acknowledged that the significant economic growth in San Simon was brought about by the Comprehensive Municipal Development and Land Use Plan enacted by the Municipal Council. The zoning ordinance reclassified the entire stretch of Quezon Road as Industrial and Commercial Zone, but limited only to light and medium size industries and those that are environmental friendly.
Another factor that contributes to the potential economic growth of San Simon in the 21st century is its geographic location. It is strategically located in the central part of the “W” Growth Corridor of Central Luzon and it is accessible from major road networks and arteries coming from the different provinces of Central Luzon and Metro Manila. From the North Luzon Expressway, one can take an exit through the San Simon Toll Plaza, which is about 45 kilometers from Metro Manila and seven kilometers from San Fernando City, Pampanga and approximately 20 kilometers from the Clark Special Economic Zone in Angeles. City.
Taking advantage of the conducive local business environment, tax incentives and availability of skilled workers, many manufacturing and commercial firms have been established or relocated in San Simon. The infusion of private capital investment was about ten billion pesos and expected to increase to more than twenty billion pesos by the early years of the 21st century.


=== Saray karsada tan tulay ===
The national and local government of San Simon have provided transportation and bridge services to the residents. Because of the infrastracture, mango orchards and the rice industry were boosted.


== Edukasiyon ==
For elementary and high school education, residents of San Simon are served by thirteen elementary schools, two barangay public high schools, and three private schools.


== Saray panawagan ==
For telecommunications, the town is served by Digitel, PLDT, PILTEL, DATELCOM, SMART, and GLOBE. Another wireless internet service provider is COMCLARK SureStream.


== Turismo, Heritage, Relihiyon tan Kultura ==
The town is rich in its past and treasures. Its town hall and churches reveal the wealth of the town's heritage.


==== (Heritage) Church ====
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Fernando has jurisdiction over the 1771 Virgen del Pilar Parish Church.

Like most Kapampangan people, residents of San Simon retain their Kapampangan language and traditional culture and arts brought about by their Malay ancestors and enriched by Chinese, Spanish, American, Japanese and other ethnic and foreign cultures.

Say Las Piñas sakey siyudad diad Pilipino ed Metro Manila.


== Say siyudad ==
Since its establishment as a small fishing port and a major salt-making center during the Spanish Era, Las Piñas has grown into an important residential, commercial and industrial suburb of Metro Manila.
Las Piñas is famous for its Bamboo Organ, located inside the St. Joseph Church of the Parish of Las Piñas, formerly known as San Jose Parish Church in the Spanish Period, as the only organ of its kind in the world. Built in 1824 by Catholic priest, Fr. Diego Cera, created out of bamboo, wood, and metal, this famous organ is praised for its unique, rare, and melodious sound.
The Sarao Motors factory is also located in Las Piñas, the place where Jeepneys are assembled piece by piece in painstaking individual production. The factory remains open to buyers and curious visitors all year round.
Las Piñas has a large shopping mall named SM Southmall, which has an area of 205,120 square meters and is located along Alabang–Zapote Road. The newest shopping mall development in the city is SM Center Las Piñas, located few meters away from the City Hall. The first high rise building in the city is 16 story residential building Almanza Metropolis.
Las Piñas, also known as one of the cleanest cities in Metro Manila, is in the list of the "Clean and Green Hall of Fame" awarded by the Philippine Government. It is also the first local government unit in the Philippines that has been honored with the prestigious Global 500 Roll of Honour of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). These honors were in recognition of the city's outstanding achievements in the protection and improvement of the environment.
Las Piñas has recently acquired the status "Most Competitive City" in the Philippines, together with Davao City, Sekano (Makati), Muntinlupa and Marikina.


== Historiya ==
Las Piñas was one of the earliest fishing settlements on the shores of Manila Bay and was proclaimed a town either in 1762 or 1797. Its exact date of creation cannot be ascertained because historical records vary. Cavada, a Spanish historian and Fr. Juan Medina placed it at 1762, while Buzeta recorded the date at 1797.
Besides being famous for its Bamboo Organ, which was built by Fr. Diego Cera and completed in 1824, the town of Las Piñas was also a major war theater during the 1896 Philippine Revolution, as it was occupied by Gen. Emilio Aquinaldo's forces. Las Piñas was also, occupied by the Japanese during Second World War, to be followed by the liberation period, when the combined Filipino and American forces fought the Japanese Imperial armed forces until the end of war.
In 1901, the Municipality of Las Piñas was incorporated from Cavite to the newly created province of Rizal pursuant to Philippine Commission Act No. 137. Two years later, it was combined with Parañaque, the latter being the seat of a new municipal government.
It became a separate municipality from Parañaque on March 27, 1907 by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 1625. Then, with the founding of the Metropolitan Manila Area (Metro Manila in short) in 1976, Las Piñas became one of the municipalities making up the region.
On February 12, 1997, President Fidel Ramos signed the bill declaring Las Piñas a new city. A plebiscite held a month after found the residents in approval of cityhood and Las Piñas became the 10th city of Metro Manila on March 26, 1997.


== Gobiyerno ==
Las Piñas, like other cities of the Philippines, is a local government unit whose powers and functions are specified by the Local Government Code of the Philippines. In general, as a city, Las Piñas is headed by a mayor who heads the city's executive function and the vice mayor who heads the city's legislative function, which is composed of twelve councilors, six each from the city's two city council districts. For representation, the city is considered as one district, and therefore one representative, in the country's House of Representatives.

=== Ed walay pa ed saray Kastila ===
Mauswagong kabalayan na ang Sugbo mga tulo ka libo ka tuig kaniadto sa pa sakopa sa Espanya. Nakigbinayloay kini sa China ug uban pang kanasuran sa sidlakang-habagatang Asya.


=== Pag-abot so sakey Kastila ===
Miabot si Fernando de Magallanes sa Sugbo niadtong Abril 7, 1521. Gidawat sila isip mga dumuduong ni Radja Humabon nga kauban sa iyang asawa ug walo ka gatos nila ka sakop gipamunyagan sa mga Kachila niadtong Abril 14 isip mga unang Pilipinhong Katoliko. Apan pakyas hinuon si Magallano sa pag-ankon sa kapupud-ang Pilipinhon isip katigayonan sa hari sa Espanya sanglit napatay man siya ni Ka Lapulapu didto sa pulo sa Mactan pagka Abril 27 niadtong tuiga.
Abril 27, 1565, midunggo sa Sugbo si Miguel Lopez de Legazpi kuyog ang Agustinhong pareng si Andres de Urdaneta. Gisalid-an ni Legazpi ang ngalan sa dakbayan gikan sa San Miguel ngadto sa Villa del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus. Sulod sa unom ka tuig ang Sugbo maoy kaulohan sa bag-ong gitukod nga kolonya sa Espanya.
Gimugna ang lalawigan sa Sugbo ubos sa Act No. 2711 niadtong Marso 10, 1917. Mao kini ang natawhang lalawigan ni Sergio Osmeña, Sr. ang misunod pagkapangulo sa Commonwealth human ni Manuel L. Quezon panahon sa Ikaduhang Gubat sa Tibuok Kalibutan.
Ang lalawigan sa Sugbo ilabi na ang dakbayan sa Sugbo nakatagamtam og pagsaka sa international investments sa naunang bahin sa dekada 1990, diin namugna ang terminong CEBOOM isip tawag adtong pasakaha sa ekonomiya.
Giplanohang ipahigayon ang ASEAN Summit sa mga dakbayan sa Sugbu, Lapulapu, ug Mandaue niadtong 2006 apan tungod sa bagyong mihasi sa taliwalang Kapilipinhan gisibog ang maong panagtapok sa Enero 2007.


== Hiyograpiya ==
Ang Kan-irag Nature Park maoy parke sa baranggay sa Pung-ol Sibugay, sa mga bukiring parte sa dakbayan. Kini nag-abri tuig 2008, ug maoy parte usab sa Central Cebu Protected Landscape. Diri makit-an ang 100 ka eksotiko ug lumad nga espesye sa kahoy ug 27 ka espesye sa langgam.

Antes pa man mag-abot ang mga Katsilang kolonisador sa Pilipinas, usa na ka sentro sa komersyo sa kapupud-an ang Sugbo. Karon, kini ang sentrong pangkomersyo sa habagatan sa nasod, ug adunay duha ka distritong pampatigayon sa dakbayan: ang sukod sa Colon Street ug ang Cebu Business Park. Sa Lahug, makit-an usab ang Asiatown IT Park, usa ka deklaradong special economic zone.

Say Urdaneta City (salitan Pangasinan: Siyudad na Urdaneta) siyudad ed luyag na Pangasinan, Filipinas. Onong ed 2000 census, walay population to ya 111,582 ya too diad 22,908 ya pamilya. The city has been identified by the Province of Pangasinan as a growth pole, thereby making the sorrounding localities as its satellite.


== Geography ==
The City of Urdaneta is located in eastern part of the Province of Pangasinan, situated on 15°56' to 16°0' latitude and 120°29' to 120°37' longitude.
Traverse by the Manila North Road virtually bisecting the locality into the west and east side. The city is bounded north by the Municipalities of Binalonan, Laoac and Manaoag, south by villasis, east by Asingan and west by Sta. Barbara and Malasiqui.
The city is approximately 186 km. from Metro Manila, 70 km. from Baguio, and 40 km. from Lingayen.


== Historical Background ==
Other localities have legends of their own as to how their names evolved. Urdaneta differs.
The Purists maintain that since the Spanish root word was organo, the correct name should have been "Organists". On the other hand, the Theorists are of the opinion that the original name of the city was "Organeta" meaning "little organ or unit" considering that at that time, the place was composed of portions of barrios of adjacent towns where travelers and traders converged.
But the next issue that biweldered the concerned groups was whether the city was named after Fr. Andres Urdaneta or Fr. Simon de Urdaneta. While the archives of the National Library show that it was after Fr. Miguel de Urdaneta, some articles on the city's history envariably reffered to Fr. Simon de Urdaneta. Curiously noted historian Fr. Jose Ma. Gonzalez, author of "Labor Evangelica y Civilizadora delos Religioso en Pangasinan", was silent in this issue.


== Creation of the City ==
On January 10, 1998, the Philippine Congress enacted and passed R.A. 8480 converting the Municipality of Urdaneta as a component city of the Province of Pangasinan. The electorate in a plebiscite overhelmingly ratified this legislative act and the locality was proclaimed as a city on March 21, 1998.


== Establishments ==
Most commercial establishments in Urdaneta such as large department and variety stores, business and professional offices, hotels and theaters are found in brgy's Poblacion, Nancayasan and San Vicente. There are also food chains such as Jollibee, McDonald's, Cindys, Shakeys, Chowking and KFC. And offices of multinational companies, among which are those of Coca-Cola Phils., Pepsi-Cola, San Miguel Corp. and Nestle products. There are also malls in the city such as Magic Mall and CB Balingit Mall. SM Prime Holdings also wants also to put up a mall in the city. The city also hosts the Sanctuary I.T. Building Pangasinan's first Philippine Ecozone Authroity (PEZA) building in Barangay Nancayasan.


== Education ==
Urdaneta city has more elementary schools and more high schools than any other cities and towns in Pangasinan.The city is a center of education in Eastern Pangasinan due to numerous tertiary institution, including:
Toplite Polytechnic Colleges, Inc.
Lyceum Northwestern University
Lyceum Northern Luzon
Urdaneta City University (UCU)
PanPacific University North Philippines (PUNP)
Urdaneta College of Technology
Divine Word College of Urdaneta
Pangasinan State University
STI-Urdaneta
AMA-Urdaneta
ABE-International College of Business and Economics
Luzon Colleges of Science and Technology


== Notable Persons ==
Dr. Pedro T. Orata - ORATA was born in Bangar, a remote sitio (section) of Barrio (village) Bactad, Urdaneta, in northern Pangasinan Province of the Philippines, on February 27, 1899. He was a Magsaysay Awardee and dubbed as the Father of barangay High Schools.
Danny Ildefonso - PBA player and two time MVP.


== Urdaneta tops in finances ==
Urdaneta City is now the cream of the crop. Based on the financial report released by the Commission on Audit for 2005, Urdaneta City is now the leading city not only in Pangasinan but in the Northwestern Luzon region in terms of net income, gross income, total assets and total equity. The COA report showed Urdaneta reported a net income of P132,107,000 with a gross income of P382,699,000 and expenses amounting to P250,582,000, considered only as the third highest among eight cities in the region. Urdaneta, which won its cityhood only in March 1998, had the highest total assets among all the region’s cities totaling P810,722,000, registering total equity of P693,166,000 with total liabilities of P117,546,000, among the lowest in the region so far.
In contrast, Dagupan City the oldest city in Region 1 had the lowest net income among in the province and among eight Northwestern Luzon Region cities at P18,901,000, according to the COA financial report. Dagupan, however, registered the second highest total income at P357,404,000 but the report showed it is also the biggest spender among all eight cities, registering total expenditure amounting to P338,503,000 in 2005.
Urdaneta and Dagupan City are the only second class cities in the Northwestern Luzon region today. But Urdaneta’s rise to second class from fourth class when it earned its city hood eight years ago is considered phenomenal.
Dagupan trails Urdaneta in total assets at P713,760,000 but again it registered the highest total liabilities among all cities in the region at P372,420,000, placing its total equity to P341,340,000.

Say Las Piñas sakey siyudad diad Pilipino ed Metro Manila.


== Say siyudad ==
Since its establishment as a small fishing port and a major salt-making center during the Spanish Era, Las Piñas has grown into an important residential, commercial and industrial suburb of Metro Manila.
Las Piñas is famous for its Bamboo Organ, located inside the St. Joseph Church of the Parish of Las Piñas, formerly known as San Jose Parish Church in the Spanish Period, as the only organ of its kind in the world. Built in 1824 by Catholic priest, Fr. Diego Cera, created out of bamboo, wood, and metal, this famous organ is praised for its unique, rare, and melodious sound.
The Sarao Motors factory is also located in Las Piñas, the place where Jeepneys are assembled piece by piece in painstaking individual production. The factory remains open to buyers and curious visitors all year round.
Las Piñas has a large shopping mall named SM Southmall, which has an area of 205,120 square meters and is located along Alabang–Zapote Road. The newest shopping mall development in the city is SM Center Las Piñas, located few meters away from the City Hall. The first high rise building in the city is 16 story residential building Almanza Metropolis.
Las Piñas, also known as one of the cleanest cities in Metro Manila, is in the list of the "Clean and Green Hall of Fame" awarded by the Philippine Government. It is also the first local government unit in the Philippines that has been honored with the prestigious Global 500 Roll of Honour of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). These honors were in recognition of the city's outstanding achievements in the protection and improvement of the environment.
Las Piñas has recently acquired the status "Most Competitive City" in the Philippines, together with Davao City, Sekano (Makati), Muntinlupa and Marikina.


== Historiya ==
Las Piñas was one of the earliest fishing settlements on the shores of Manila Bay and was proclaimed a town either in 1762 or 1797. Its exact date of creation cannot be ascertained because historical records vary. Cavada, a Spanish historian and Fr. Juan Medina placed it at 1762, while Buzeta recorded the date at 1797.
Besides being famous for its Bamboo Organ, which was built by Fr. Diego Cera and completed in 1824, the town of Las Piñas was also a major war theater during the 1896 Philippine Revolution, as it was occupied by Gen. Emilio Aquinaldo's forces. Las Piñas was also, occupied by the Japanese during Second World War, to be followed by the liberation period, when the combined Filipino and American forces fought the Japanese Imperial armed forces until the end of war.
In 1901, the Municipality of Las Piñas was incorporated from Cavite to the newly created province of Rizal pursuant to Philippine Commission Act No. 137. Two years later, it was combined with Parañaque, the latter being the seat of a new municipal government.
It became a separate municipality from Parañaque on March 27, 1907 by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 1625. Then, with the founding of the Metropolitan Manila Area (Metro Manila in short) in 1976, Las Piñas became one of the municipalities making up the region.
On February 12, 1997, President Fidel Ramos signed the bill declaring Las Piñas a new city. A plebiscite held a month after found the residents in approval of cityhood and Las Piñas became the 10th city of Metro Manila on March 26, 1997.

Las Piñas, like other cities of the Philippines, is a local government unit whose powers and functions are specified by the Local Government Code of the Philippines. In general, as a city, Las Piñas is headed by a mayor who heads the city's executive function and the vice mayor who heads the city's legislative function, which is composed of twelve councilors, six each from the city's two city council districts. For representation, the city is considered as one district, and therefore one representative, in the country's House of Representatives.
Additionally, like other cities and municipalities, Las Piñas is subdivided into barangays.

Say Dagupan City (salitan Pangasinan: Siyudad na Dagupan) sakey 3rd class siyudad ed luyag na Pangasinan, Filipinas. Onong ed 2000 census, walay population to ya 130,328 ya too diad 25,921 ya pamilya. According to the same survey, Pangasinan is the most populous province in the Philippines. Located on Lingayen Gulf on the island of Luzon, Dagupan is the chief port and commercial and financial center of the province and Northern Luzon; an active trade is conducted in sugarcane, corn, rice, copra, salt, and an alcoholic liquor produced from the nipa palm. The city is known as the Bangus (milkfish) capital of the Philippines because of its abundance of fresh bangus.
The longest barbecue measured 1,007.56 m (3,305.64 ft) - it was created by the people of Dagupan City on May 3, 2003 as part of the city’s Bangus Festival.


== Geography ==


== History ==


=== Pre-Hispanic times ===
Pangasinan in the 16th century, they found that Lingayen Gulf was already a prosperous entrepot visited by traders from other Asian countries. The Augustinian missionary Juan de la Concepcion noted that the communities at Lingayen, Bolinao and the defunct Binalatongan exercised authority over other communities (called baley in the Pangasinan language) in the area. De la Concepcion also mentioned several other towns but did not identify them.


=== Spanish colonial period ===
The area that is now known as Dagupan was described as marshland thickly covered with mangrove and nipa palm trees. The natives lived along the shoreline and riverbanks of Calmay, Pantal, and Bonuan. But there were also communities in Malaued, Lasip, Pogo, and Bacayao. The natives called the area Bacnotan which would later be incorporated into the encomienda of Lingayen that was established in 1583.
The foreign traders would come to the Lingayen coast to trade gold that was brought down to the area by tribesmen in the Cordillera Mountains. Aside from traders, Filipinos also had experience with pirates from Japan and China. One of the Chinese corsairs was Lim Feng (in Fukienese, Lim A-hong), who would be known in Philippine history as Limahong.
Limahong sailed down the Ilocos coast with 62 ships and attacked Manila on Nov. 30, 1574. The Spanish, however, repulsed Limahong's two attacks. The Chinese corsair repaired to Pangasinan to establish a colony at Bacnotan on December 2, 1574. But the Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo laid siege on his fortress for eight months by blocking the river outlets. Limahong puportedly broke through the siege by digging a channel from the Agno River through the Bacnotan marshes to Lingayen Gulf
In 1661, a big fire hit Bacnotan during the Malong Revolt, led by Andres Malong of Binalatongan, against the forced labor and mandatory sale of local goods imposed by the Spanish colonial government. The fire broke out after Malong sent 3,000 supporters, most of whom were Zambal tribesmen, to Ilocos and Cagayan to fight the Spaniards. The people of Bacnotan, many of whom joined the Spanish in repelling the Zambal marauders, rebuilt the town and renamed it Nandaragupan, meaning where once stood the commercial center, indicating its early importance as a trade, commercial and political center in the region. In 1720, Nandaragupan was chartered as a town but its name was simplified to Dagupan. Malong was eventually beheaded in the city's Pantal bridge in 1661 by Spanish authorities.
Dagupan was also the birthplace of a ladino named Caragay who led another uprising in 1719 against the provincial governor (alcalde mayor, in Spanish) who had him flogged for what appeared to be a false accusation of smuggling. Governor Antonio del Valle had Caragay arrested in the village of Nantagalan, northeast of San Jacinto and Mangaldan and flogged. Vowing vengeance, Caragay organized a band of men who hounded the governor until they were able to kill him. Historians view Caragay as a "model" of the revolts of Palaris and Diego Silang. More than Malong, historians view Caragay as a "model" of the revolts of Palaris and Diego Silang. In 1762, Dagupan would be one of the first towns to join the Palaris Revolt against Spain.
In 1780, Pantal, originally named Pantalan (port), became a trading center and docking station for merchant ships. At about the same time, the bangus industry thrived and mangrove swamps were converted into fishponds, starting the land conversions that would later have an impact on flooding and earthquake damage in the province. The opening of the Pantalan dock eased the transportation of goods from Pangasinan to other parts of the country, spurring the cultivation of idle lands in the eastern part and the development of fishponds in the western part of the province. The new dock also eased communications between the colonial government, its soldiers and the missionaries, who were tasked to colonize the natives in the Cordillera Mountains and the Cagayan Valley region and exploit its gold deposits.
In July 1787, the Spanish began to build a road to connect Pangasinan and the Cagayan Valley, the home of several head-hunting tribesmen who refused to submit to Spanish rule. Although it took several years to complete, the road would play a vital role in the colonization of the Cagayan Valley and the Cordillera Mountains.
The Palaris and Silang revolts, which occurred simultaneously with the British Invasion of the Philippines demonstrated to the Spaniards the importance of ports in Pangasin and Ilocos to the security of the entire island of Luzon. They thus became centers of Spanish governance and acculturation in the 19th century. When the port of Manila was opened to foreign trade in 1830, tobacco from Pangasinan and Cagayan Valley were shipped to the colonial capital via Dagupan and Lingayen. Foreign trading agents also began to make appearances in the two towns, starting a new era of prosperity, especially for the provincial gentry.
The Filipino scholar Maximo Kalaw found the description of the American writer David Barrows as appropriate:
The Filipino had now become embarked upon a new current of intellectual experience -- a course of enlightenment which has been so full of unexpected development... Throughout the islands a class was rapidly growing up to which the new industries had brought wealth. Their means enabled them to build spacious and splendid homes of the fine hardwoods of the Philippines, and to surround themselves with such luxuries as the life of the islands permitted. This class was rapidly gaining education.
This was also true of the Dagupan gentry. Trade enriched many families and allowed them to send their scions to study overseas. These young men returned to the Philippines not only with technical knowledge in their chosen fields but also with the intellectual currents of the time, including constitutional republicanism which swept Spain in 1810.
News from the colonial government in Manila also reached Dagupan at a faster pace with the completion of the Manila-Dagupan Railway in 1891. The railway would play a significant role not only in the economic development of Pangasinan but also in the success of the Philippine Revolution.


=== Under the First Philippine Republic ===
Not much is known of Dagupeños involvement in the Katipunan and the first and second parts of the Philippine Revolution. But on Mar. 7, 1898, the Dagupeños unveiled a coordinated attack on Spanish forces that appears to have been planned months in advance. It is now known as the Battle of Dagupan (1898)
The Dagupeño leaders of the attack were Juan Solis Galvan, Teodoro Villamil, Pedro de Venecia, Macario Meneses and Daniel Maramba. They were under the overall command of Francisco Macabulos, who had just liberated the provinces of Pampanga and Tarlac. He was assisted by Ramon Manalang, who was based in Alaminos. Communications between Macabulos and Manalang was coordinated by Macario Meneses of Bonuan.
The Spanish forces were commanded by Federico Caballos, who had troops garrisoned at all the towns of Pangasinan. In Dagupan, he had men at the Colegio de San Alberto Magno, which guarded the western approach to the town; at the foot of Quintos Bridge, which guarded the east; and his main force at the Catholic Church.
Although the revolutionary forces were ill equipped (most of them armed only with bolos and lances), they attacked the Spanish with an ingenious rolling trench. The "trenches" were made of several banana tree trunks, wrapped in sheets of dried nipa palm leaves. The trenches were seven feet in diameter and the revolutionists would roll the it toward Spanish positions so they could fight them in close quarter with their bolos and lances.
Galvan led the back at the Colegio de San Alberto Magno while Villamil and De Venecia swooped down on the enemies at Quintos Bridge. The Tagalog forces from Nueva Ecija, who were better armed, joined the Dagupeños who attacked the Spanish position at the church. The Dagupeños held the Spanish troops at bay in Dagupan while other revolutionists liberated other towns in the province. Maramba later joined the battle after fighting in Sta. Barbara and Mangaldan.
By July 21, after four months and 16 days, Macabulos unleashed a concerted attack. The Spanish and Filipino troops exchanged fire for two nights and a day before Caballos surrendered on July 23 1898, six weeks after the Declaration of Philippine Independence on June 12, 1898.
After the town returned to normal, President Emilio Aguinaldo named Galvan president of the municipal council. Galvan was a ranking officer of the Katipunan. Galvan Street along which the public market was built was named after him.


=== American colonial period ===
On January 8-9, 1945, U.S. General Douglas MacArthur landed his amphibious liberation force in the city's "Blue Beach" section along the Lingayen Gulf. From his beachhead in Dagupan, along with those in neighboring towns Lingayen and San Fabian, MacArthur's forces under General Walter Krueger were able to penetrate Japanese defenses in Luzon island and liberate Filipino and allied prisoners of war in Manila's University of Sto. Tomas.


=== Dagupan becomes a city ===
Dagupan became a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 170, authored by Speaker Eugenio Perez. It was signed into law by President Manuel Roxas on June 20, 1947.
On October 15, 1947, President Roxas issued Executive Order No. 96 fixing the city limits to include the towns of San Fabian, Pangasinan and Calasiao, Pangasinan but the residents of Calasiao rejected inclusion into the new city, causing controversy over the election that was held on Nov. 10, 1947.
The dispute was brought before the Supreme Court of the Philippines which subsequently validated the election and ruled that Dagupan became a city on June 20, 1947, when Roxas signed the charter into law.
Despite the controversy attending Dagupan's rise as a city, the new city mayor, Angel B. Fernandez, embarked on an infrastructure program that would develop erswhile idle swamplands toward the south and west.
In 1948, he built a road from barrio Mayombo to barrio Tapuac, passing through the edge of barrio Pogo Chico. The road, built mostly on reclaimed swampland, was named Perez Boulevard, in honor of Dagupan's first lawyer and Assemblyman Rodrigo Perez. The road was needed because of the increasing number of commercial establishments on Torres Bugallon Avenue and the growing number of residents at the southern limits of the city. In 1946, the Dagupan City High School was transferred from Torres Bugallon Avenue. Perez Boulevard expanded the commercial area south especially after Fernandez built a new public market at the bank of the river.
Later, Fernandez's successor Teofilo Guadiz, who served from 1954-1957 and 1958-1959, would also contribute to the city's expansion by extending Rizal Street, which was only then from Torres Bugallon to Rivera Street, up to the Iglesia ni Cristo compound. Also, he extended Galvan Street, which was then up to Gomez Street only, up to Perez Boulevard. He also secured funds from Senator Cipriano P. Primicias Sr., a native of Pangasinan, to build a two-story semi-permanent building for the city high school. Guadiz also replaced the Bailey bridge on Perez Boulevard with a concrete one.
The westward expansion of the city went as far as Lucao which was also swampland. Local historian Restituto Basa surmised that the name Lucao may have been derived from the shellfish called lukan that used to abound in the swampy area.
In June 1962, Dagupan was shaken by a series of strong earthquakes which occurred at irregular intervals for about three weeks. The quakes toppled the belfry of the Roman Catholic Church. The epicenter of the earthquake was in Calmay, where real estate values dropped after the temblors. Many people from Calmay, Carael and island barrios evacuated to other towns.
In 1968, the national government agencies opened offices in Dagupan and other key cities across the country. The daytime population increased sustantially, causing congestion in the city that began to see the appearance of public utility tricycles.
On July 16, 1990, an magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck northern Luzon. The worst hit cities were Cabanatuan, Baguio and Dagupan.
Many public and private structures were destroyed or damaged when river banks slid into the Pantal River and dry land into the swampy areas. Streets were ruptured and the ground subsided, causing buildings to sink by as much as two meters. Other buildings tilted severely, especially along Perez Boulevard. One building tilted by as much as 19 degrees, but generally, the magnitude of tilt was within 2-5 degrees.
There were sand boils in several areas in the city and drainage systems were clogged by the accumulated sand causing temporary flooding of the city's main thoroughfares. Some houses remained underwater by 30-50 cms. for several months. The whole stretch of Don Jose Calimlim Street and swampy areas and fishpond communities, such as Barangay Lasip Grande, remained underwater even during low tide conditions.

At the height of the earthquake, an eyewitness told experts of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology that he saw rolling during the earthquake and a jeep parked along the road vanished from his sight.
Scientists blamed the destruction on the liquefaction of land that was had not compacted enough since it was reclaimed from the swamp or marsh. It was also blamed on the active shifting of Pantal River, which left abandoned meanders on which people built structures. Varying degrees of damage were sustained in the different affected areas of Dagupan City. Phivolcs said a study of the damage during the earthquake indicate that susceptibility to liquefaction in different parts of Dagupan City can be related to the relative ages of the geologic features and the deposits underlying them.
The degree of destruction along A.B. Fernandez Avenue, which largely lies on reclaimed swampland, was generally less than that in the Perez Blvd. area except near its intersection with Rizal Street. The great degree of liquefaction along a 100m stretch of A.B. Fernandez Ave. can be traced to changes in the channel of Pantal River. Prior to north eastward expansion of Dagupan City, Pantal River used to meander around the area now partly occupied by A.B. Fernandez Ave. and Rizal St. before running parallel to Pantal Road.

Metro Manila is the political, economic, social, and cultural center of the country, and it is one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world. Metro Manila is often simply referred to as Manila, especially by non-residents, and is abbreviated as M.M.. The region is also sometimes called the Greater Manila Area, but this term usually also includes adjacent towns not strictly a part of Metro Manila.
Metro Manila is the smallest of the country's regions, but the most populous and the most densely populated, having a population of 9,932,560 (2000 census) in an area only 636 square kilometers large. It is also the only region without any provinces. The region is bordered by the provinces of Bulacan to the north, Rizal to the east, and Cavite and Laguna to the south. Metro Manila is also sandwiched by the Manila Bay to the west and the Laguna de Bay to the southeast with the Pasig River running between them, bisecting the region.
Unlike other regions which are divided into provinces, Metro Manila or the National Capital Region (NCR) is divided into four districts. These districts were created in 1976 but have no local government and no congressional representation (unlike the districts in the provinces). They are used mostly for fiscal and statistical purposes. The cities and municipalities within the NCR are grouped into the four districts as follows:
First District: Manila
Second District: Mandaluyong City, Marikina City, Pasig City, Quezon City and San Juan
Third District: Caloocan City, Malabon City, Navotas and Valenzuela City.
Fourth District: Las Piñas City, Makati City, Muntinlupa City, Parañaque City, Pasay City, Pateros and Taguig City
The term Metro Manila should not be confused with the metro rail system of the region, and the word metro itself always describes the metropolitan area (as in the metro). The railways are called by their abbreviations, such as the LRT and the MRT.Sakey ya popular ya Japanese anison mang-aawit, kompositor san actor si Ichiro Mizuki (水木 一郎 Mizuki Ichirou).

== Historiya ==


=== Ed walay pa ed saray Kastila ===
Mauswagong kabalayan na ang Sugbo mga tulo ka libo ka tuig kaniadto sa pa sakopa sa Espanya. Nakigbinayloay kini sa China ug uban pang kanasuran sa sidlakang-habagatang Asya.


=== Pag-abot so sakey Kastila ===
Miabot si Fernando de Magallanes sa Sugbo niadtong Abril 7, 1521. Gidawat sila isip mga dumuduong ni Radja Humabon nga kauban sa iyang asawa ug walo ka gatos nila ka sakop gipamunyagan sa mga Kachila niadtong Abril 14 isip mga unang Pilipinhong Katoliko. Apan pakyas hinuon si Magallano sa pag-ankon sa kapupud-ang Pilipinhon isip katigayonan sa hari sa Espanya sanglit napatay man siya ni Ka Lapulapu didto sa pulo sa Mactan pagka Abril 27 niadtong tuiga.
Abril 27, 1565, midunggo sa Sugbo si Miguel Lopez de Legazpi kuyog ang Agustinhong pareng si Andres de Urdaneta. Gisalid-an ni Legazpi ang ngalan sa dakbayan gikan sa San Miguel ngadto sa Villa del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus. Sulod sa unom ka tuig ang Sugbo maoy kaulohan sa bag-ong gitukod nga kolonya sa Espanya.
Gimugna ang lalawigan sa Sugbo ubos sa Act No. 2711 niadtong Marso 10, 1917. Mao kini ang natawhang lalawigan ni Sergio Osmeña, Sr. ang misunod pagkapangulo sa Commonwealth human ni Manuel L. Quezon panahon sa Ikaduhang Gubat sa Tibuok Kalibutan.
Ang lalawigan sa Sugbo ilabi na ang dakbayan sa Sugbo nakatagamtam og pagsaka sa international investments sa naunang bahin sa dekada 1990, diin namugna ang terminong CEBOOM isip tawag adtong pasakaha sa ekonomiya.
Giplanohang ipahigayon ang ASEAN Summit sa mga dakbayan sa Sugbu, Lapulapu, ug Mandaue niadtong 2006 apan tungod sa bagyong mihasi sa taliwalang Kapilipinhan gisibog ang maong panagtapok sa Enero 2007.


== Hiyograpiya ==
Ang Kan-irag Nature Park maoy parke sa baranggay sa Pung-ol Sibugay, sa mga bukiring parte sa dakbayan. Kini nag-abri tuig 2008, ug maoy parte usab sa Central Cebu Protected Landscape. Diri makit-an ang 100 ka eksotiko ug lumad nga espesye sa kahoy ug 27 ka espesye sa langgam.

== Ekonomiya ==
Antes pa man mag-abot ang mga Katsilang kolonisador sa Pilipinas, usa na ka sentro sa komersyo sa kapupud-an ang Sugbo. Karon, kini ang sentrong pangkomersyo sa habagatan sa nasod, ug adunay duha ka distritong pampatigayon sa dakbayan: ang sukod sa Colon Street ug ang Cebu Business Park. Sa Lahug, makit-an usab ang Asiatown IT Park, usa ka deklaradong special economic zone.

Say Las Piñas sakey siyudad diad Pilipino ed Metro Manila.


== Say siyudad ==
Since its establishment as a small fishing port and a major salt-making center during the Spanish Era, Las Piñas has grown into an important residential, commercial and industrial suburb of Metro Manila.
Las Piñas is famous for its Bamboo Organ, located inside the St. Joseph Church of the Parish of Las Piñas, formerly known as San Jose Parish Church in the Spanish Period, as the only organ of its kind in the world. Built in 1824 by Catholic priest, Fr. Diego Cera, created out of bamboo, wood, and metal, this famous organ is praised for its unique, rare, and melodious sound.
The Sarao Motors factory is also located in Las Piñas, the place where Jeepneys are assembled piece by piece in painstaking individual production. The factory remains open to buyers and curious visitors all year round.
Las Piñas has a large shopping mall named SM Southmall, which has an area of 205,120 square meters and is located along Alabang–Zapote Road. The newest shopping mall development in the city is SM Center Las Piñas, located few meters away from the City Hall. The first high rise building in the city is 16 story residential building Almanza Metropolis.
Las Piñas, also known as one of the cleanest cities in Metro Manila, is in the list of the "Clean and Green Hall of Fame" awarded by the Philippine Government. It is also the first local government unit in the Philippines that has been honored with the prestigious Global 500 Roll of Honour of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). These honors were in recognition of the city's outstanding achievements in the protection and improvement of the environment.
Las Piñas has recently acquired the status "Most Competitive City" in the Philippines, together with Davao City, Sekano (Makati), Muntinlupa and Marikina.


== Historiya ==
Las Piñas was one of the earliest fishing settlements on the shores of Manila Bay and was proclaimed a town either in 1762 or 1797. Its exact date of creation cannot be ascertained because historical records vary. Cavada, a Spanish historian and Fr. Juan Medina placed it at 1762, while Buzeta recorded the date at 1797.
Besides being famous for its Bamboo Organ, which was built by Fr. Diego Cera and completed in 1824, the town of Las Piñas was also a major war theater during the 1896 Philippine Revolution, as it was occupied by Gen. Emilio Aquinaldo's forces. Las Piñas was also, occupied by the Japanese during Second World War, to be followed by the liberation period, when the combined Filipino and American forces fought the Japanese Imperial armed forces until the end of war.
In 1901, the Municipality of Las Piñas was incorporated from Cavite to the newly created province of Rizal pursuant to Philippine Commission Act No. 137. Two years later, it was combined with Parañaque, the latter being the seat of a new municipal government.
It became a separate municipality from Parañaque on March 27, 1907 by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 1625. Then, with the founding of the Metropolitan Manila Area (Metro Manila in short) in 1976, Las Piñas became one of the municipalities making up the region.
On February 12, 1997, President Fidel Ramos signed the bill declaring Las Piñas a new city. A plebiscite held a month after found the residents in approval of cityhood and Las Piñas became the 10th city of Metro Manila on March 26, 1997.


== Gobiyerno ==
Las Piñas, like other cities of the Philippines, is a local government unit whose powers and functions are specified by the Local Government Code of the Philippines. In general, as a city, Las Piñas is headed by a mayor who heads the city's executive function and the vice mayor who heads the city's legislative function, which is composed of twelve councilors, six each from the city's two city council districts. For representation, the city is considered as one district, and therefore one representative, in the country's House of Representatives.
Additionally, like other cities and municipalities, Las Piñas is subdivided into barangays.

Cagayan Valley (Lambak ng Cagayan in Filipino) is a region of the Philippines, also designated as Region II or Region 02. It is composed of five provinces, namely: Batanes, Cagayan, Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya, and Quirino. Its regional center is Tuguegarao City.
Most of the region lies in a large valley in northeastern Luzon, between the Cordilleras and the Sierra Madre mountain ranges. Cagayan River, the country's longest river runs through its center and flows out to Luzon Strait in the north, in the town of Aparri, Cagayan. The Babuyan and Batanes island groups that lie in the Luzon Strait also belong to the region.

Europe is the world's second-smallest continent in terms of area, covering about 10 400 000 square kilometres (4,010,000 sq mi) or 2.0% of the Earth's surface. The only continent smaller than Europe is Australia. In terms of population, it is the third-largest continent (after Asia and Afrika) with a population of some 710,000,000, or about 11% of the world's population.
The European Union – comprising 25 member states, with two countries acceding in 2007 (Bulgaria and Romania) and two candidates in accession negotiations (Turkey and Croatia) – is the largest political and economic entity covering the European continent, while Russia (excluding portions in Asia) is the second largest entity and Europe's largest state in area and population.

Metro Manila is the political, economic, social, and cultural center of the country, and it is one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world. Metro Manila is often simply referred to as Manila, especially by non-residents, and is abbreviated as M.M.. The region is also sometimes called the Greater Manila Area, but this term usually also includes adjacent towns not strictly a part of Metro Manila.
Metro Manila is the smallest of the country's regions, but the most populous and the most densely populated, having a population of 9,932,560 (2000 census) in an area only 636 square kilometers large. It is also the only region without any provinces. The region is bordered by the provinces of Bulacan to the north, Rizal to the east, and Cavite and Laguna to the south. Metro Manila is also sandwiched by the Manila Bay to the west and the Laguna de Bay to the southeast with the Pasig River running between them, bisecting the region.
Unlike other regions which are divided into provinces, Metro Manila or the National Capital Region (NCR) is divided into four districts. These districts were created in 1976 but have no local government and no congressional representation (unlike the districts in the provinces). They are used mostly for fiscal and statistical purposes. The cities and municipalities within the NCR are grouped into the four districts as follows:
First District: Manila
Second District: Mandaluyong City, Marikina City, Pasig City, Quezon City and San Juan
Third District: Caloocan City, Malabon City, Navotas and Valenzuela City.
Fourth District: Las Piñas City, Makati City, Muntinlupa City, Parañaque City, Pasay City, Pateros and Taguig City
The term Metro Manila should not be confused with the metro rail system of the region, and the word metro itself always describes the metropolitan area (as in the metro). The railways are called by their abbreviations, such as the LRT and the MRT.Ipatalos yo pa ya ed salitan Pangasinan. Sarag yon dagdagan o bawasan. Salamat.

Say Dagupan City (salitan Pangasinan: Siyudad na Dagupan) sakey 3rd class siyudad ed luyag na Pangasinan, Filipinas. Onong ed 2000 census, walay population to ya 130,328 ya too diad 25,921 ya pamilya. According to the same survey, Pangasinan is the most populous province in the Philippines. Located on Lingayen Gulf on the island of Luzon, Dagupan is the chief port and commercial and financial center of the province and Northern Luzon; an active trade is conducted in sugarcane, corn, rice, copra, salt, and an alcoholic liquor produced from the nipa palm. The city is known as the Bangus (milkfish) capital of the Philippines because of its abundance of fresh bangus.
The longest barbecue measured 1,007.56 m (3,305.64 ft) - it was created by the people of Dagupan City on May 3, 2003 as part of the city’s Bangus Festival.


== Geography ==


== History ==


=== Pre-Hispanic times ===
Pangasinan in the 16th century, they found that Lingayen Gulf was already a prosperous entrepot visited by traders from other Asian countries. The Augustinian missionary Juan de la Concepcion noted that the communities at Lingayen, Bolinao and the defunct Binalatongan exercised authority over other communities (called baley in the Pangasinan language) in the area. De la Concepcion also mentioned several other towns but did not identify them.


=== Spanish colonial period ===
The area that is now known as Dagupan was described as marshland thickly covered with mangrove and nipa palm trees. The natives lived along the shoreline and riverbanks of Calmay, Pantal, and Bonuan. But there were also communities in Malaued, Lasip, Pogo, and Bacayao. The natives called the area Bacnotan which would later be incorporated into the encomienda of Lingayen that was established in 1583.
The foreign traders would come to the Lingayen coast to trade gold that was brought down to the area by tribesmen in the Cordillera Mountains. Aside from traders, Filipinos also had experience with pirates from Japan and China. One of the Chinese corsairs was Lim Feng (in Fukienese, Lim A-hong), who would be known in Philippine history as Limahong.
Limahong sailed down the Ilocos coast with 62 ships and attacked Manila on Nov. 30, 1574. The Spanish, however, repulsed Limahong's two attacks. The Chinese corsair repaired to Pangasinan to establish a colony at Bacnotan on December 2, 1574. But the Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo laid siege on his fortress for eight months by blocking the river outlets. Limahong puportedly broke through the siege by digging a channel from the Agno River through the Bacnotan marshes to Lingayen Gulf
In 1661, a big fire hit Bacnotan during the Malong Revolt, led by Andres Malong of Binalatongan, against the forced labor and mandatory sale of local goods imposed by the Spanish colonial government. The fire broke out after Malong sent 3,000 supporters, most of whom were Zambal tribesmen, to Ilocos and Cagayan to fight the Spaniards. The people of Bacnotan, many of whom joined the Spanish in repelling the Zambal marauders, rebuilt the town and renamed it Nandaragupan, meaning where once stood the commercial center, indicating its early importance as a trade, commercial and political center in the region. In 1720, Nandaragupan was chartered as a town but its name was simplified to Dagupan. Malong was eventually beheaded in the city's Pantal bridge in 1661 by Spanish authorities.
Dagupan was also the birthplace of a ladino named Caragay who led another uprising in 1719 against the provincial governor (alcalde mayor, in Spanish) who had him flogged for what appeared to be a false accusation of smuggling. Governor Antonio del Valle had Caragay arrested in the village of Nantagalan, northeast of San Jacinto and Mangaldan and flogged. Vowing vengeance, Caragay organized a band of men who hounded the governor until they were able to kill him. Historians view Caragay as a "model" of the revolts of Palaris and Diego Silang. More than Malong, historians view Caragay as a "model" of the revolts of Palaris and Diego Silang. In 1762, Dagupan would be one of the first towns to join the Palaris Revolt against Spain.
In 1780, Pantal, originally named Pantalan (port), became a trading center and docking station for merchant ships. At about the same time, the bangus industry thrived and mangrove swamps were converted into fishponds, starting the land conversions that would later have an impact on flooding and earthquake damage in the province. The opening of the Pantalan dock eased the transportation of goods from Pangasinan to other parts of the country, spurring the cultivation of idle lands in the eastern part and the development of fishponds in the western part of the province. The new dock also eased communications between the colonial government, its soldiers and the missionaries, who were tasked to colonize the natives in the Cordillera Mountains and the Cagayan Valley region and exploit its gold deposits.
In July 1787, the Spanish began to build a road to connect Pangasinan and the Cagayan Valley, the home of several head-hunting tribesmen who refused to submit to Spanish rule. Although it took several years to complete, the road would play a vital role in the colonization of the Cagayan Valley and the Cordillera Mountains.
The Palaris and Silang revolts, which occurred simultaneously with the British Invasion of the Philippines demonstrated to the Spaniards the importance of ports in Pangasin and Ilocos to the security of the entire island of Luzon. They thus became centers of Spanish governance and acculturation in the 19th century. When the port of Manila was opened to foreign trade in 1830, tobacco from Pangasinan and Cagayan Valley were shipped to the colonial capital via Dagupan and Lingayen. Foreign trading agents also began to make appearances in the two towns, starting a new era of prosperity, especially for the provincial gentry.
The Filipino scholar Maximo Kalaw found the description of the American writer David Barrows as appropriate:
The Filipino had now become embarked upon a new current of intellectual experience -- a course of enlightenment which has been so full of unexpected development... Throughout the islands a class was rapidly growing up to which the new industries had brought wealth. Their means enabled them to build spacious and splendid homes of the fine hardwoods of the Philippines, and to surround themselves with such luxuries as the life of the islands permitted. This class was rapidly gaining education.
This was also true of the Dagupan gentry. Trade enriched many families and allowed them to send their scions to study overseas. These young men returned to the Philippines not only with technical knowledge in their chosen fields but also with the intellectual currents of the time, including constitutional republicanism which swept Spain in 1810.
News from the colonial government in Manila also reached Dagupan at a faster pace with the completion of the Manila-Dagupan Railway in 1891. The railway would play a significant role not only in the economic development of Pangasinan but also in the success of the Philippine Revolution.


=== Under the First Philippine Republic ===
Not much is known of Dagupeños involvement in the Katipunan and the first and second parts of the Philippine Revolution. But on Mar. 7, 1898, the Dagupeños unveiled a coordinated attack on Spanish forces that appears to have been planned months in advance. It is now known as the Battle of Dagupan (1898)
The Dagupeño leaders of the attack were Juan Solis Galvan, Teodoro Villamil, Pedro de Venecia, Macario Meneses and Daniel Maramba. They were under the overall command of Francisco Macabulos, who had just liberated the provinces of Pampanga and Tarlac. He was assisted by Ramon Manalang, who was based in Alaminos. Communications between Macabulos and Manalang was coordinated by Macario Meneses of Bonuan.
The Spanish forces were commanded by Federico Caballos, who had troops garrisoned at all the towns of Pangasinan. In Dagupan, he had men at the Colegio de San Alberto Magno, which guarded the western approach to the town; at the foot of Quintos Bridge, which guarded the east; and his main force at the Catholic Church.
Although the revolutionary forces were ill equipped (most of them armed only with bolos and lances), they attacked the Spanish with an ingenious rolling trench. The "trenches" were made of several banana tree trunks, wrapped in sheets of dried nipa palm leaves. The trenches were seven feet in diameter and the revolutionists would roll the it toward Spanish positions so they could fight them in close quarter with their bolos and lances.
Galvan led the back at the Colegio de San Alberto Magno while Villamil and De Venecia swooped down on the enemies at Quintos Bridge. The Tagalog forces from Nueva Ecija, who were better armed, joined the Dagupeños who attacked the Spanish position at the church. The Dagupeños held the Spanish troops at bay in Dagupan while other revolutionists liberated other towns in the province. Maramba later joined the battle after fighting in Sta. Barbara and Mangaldan.
By July 21, after four months and 16 days, Macabulos unleashed a concerted attack. The Spanish and Filipino troops exchanged fire for two nights and a day before Caballos surrendered on July 23 1898, six weeks after the Declaration of Philippine Independence on June 12, 1898.
After the town returned to normal, President Emilio Aguinaldo named Galvan president of the municipal council. Galvan was a ranking officer of the Katipunan. Galvan Street along which the public market was built was named after him.


=== American colonial period ===
On January 8-9, 1945, U.S. General Douglas MacArthur landed his amphibious liberation force in the city's "Blue Beach" section along the Lingayen Gulf. From his beachhead in Dagupan, along with those in neighboring towns Lingayen and San Fabian, MacArthur's forces under General Walter Krueger were able to penetrate Japanese defenses in Luzon island and liberate Filipino and allied prisoners of war in Manila's University of Sto. Tomas.


=== Dagupan becomes a city ===
Dagupan became a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 170, authored by Speaker Eugenio Perez. It was signed into law by President Manuel Roxas on June 20, 1947.
On October 15, 1947, President Roxas issued Executive Order No. 96 fixing the city limits to include the towns of San Fabian, Pangasinan and Calasiao, Pangasinan but the residents of Calasiao rejected inclusion into the new city, causing controversy over the election that was held on Nov. 10, 1947.
The dispute was brought before the Supreme Court of the Philippines which subsequently validated the election and ruled that Dagupan became a city on June 20, 1947, when Roxas signed the charter into law.
Despite the controversy attending Dagupan's rise as a city, the new city mayor, Angel B. Fernandez, embarked on an infrastructure program that would develop erswhile idle swamplands toward the south and west.
In 1948, he built a road from barrio Mayombo to barrio Tapuac, passing through the edge of barrio Pogo Chico. The road, built mostly on reclaimed swampland, was named Perez Boulevard, in honor of Dagupan's first lawyer and Assemblyman Rodrigo Perez. The road was needed because of the increasing number of commercial establishments on Torres Bugallon Avenue and the growing number of residents at the southern limits of the city. In 1946, the Dagupan City High School was transferred from Torres Bugallon Avenue. Perez Boulevard expanded the commercial area south especially after Fernandez built a new public market at the bank of the river.
Later, Fernandez's successor Teofilo Guadiz, who served from 1954-1957 and 1958-1959, would also contribute to the city's expansion by extending Rizal Street, which was only then from Torres Bugallon to Rivera Street, up to the Iglesia ni Cristo compound. Also, he extended Galvan Street, which was then up to Gomez Street only, up to Perez Boulevard. He also secured funds from Senator Cipriano P. Primicias Sr., a native of Pangasinan, to build a two-story semi-permanent building for the city high school. Guadiz also replaced the Bailey bridge on Perez Boulevard with a concrete one.
The westward expansion of the city went as far as Lucao which was also swampland. Local historian Restituto Basa surmised that the name Lucao may have been derived from the shellfish called lukan that used to abound in the swampy area.
In June 1962, Dagupan was shaken by a series of strong earthquakes which occurred at irregular intervals for about three weeks. The quakes toppled the belfry of the Roman Catholic Church. The epicenter of the earthquake was in Calmay, where real estate values dropped after the temblors. Many people from Calmay, Carael and island barrios evacuated to other towns.
In 1968, the national government agencies opened offices in Dagupan and other key cities across the country. The daytime population increased sustantially, causing congestion in the city that began to see the appearance of public utility tricycles.
On July 16, 1990, an magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck northern Luzon. The worst hit cities were Cabanatuan, Baguio and Dagupan.
Many public and private structures were destroyed or damaged when river banks slid into the Pantal River and dry land into the swampy areas. Streets were ruptured and the ground subsided, causing buildings to sink by as much as two meters. Other buildings tilted severely, especially along Perez Boulevard. One building tilted by as much as 19 degrees, but generally, the magnitude of tilt was within 2-5 degrees.
There were sand boils in several areas in the city and drainage systems were clogged by the accumulated sand causing temporary flooding of the city's main thoroughfares. Some houses remained underwater by 30-50 cms. for several months. The whole stretch of Don Jose Calimlim Street and swampy areas and fishpond communities, such as Barangay Lasip Grande, remained underwater even during low tide conditions.

At the height of the earthquake, an eyewitness told experts of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology that he saw rolling during the earthquake and a jeep parked along the road vanished from his sight.
Scientists blamed the destruction on the liquefaction of land that was had not compacted enough since it was reclaimed from the swamp or marsh. It was also blamed on the active shifting of Pantal River, which left abandoned meanders on which people built structures. Varying degrees of damage were sustained in the different affected areas of Dagupan City. Phivolcs said a study of the damage during the earthquake indicate that susceptibility to liquefaction in different parts of Dagupan City can be related to the relative ages of the geologic features and the deposits underlying them.
The degree of destruction along A.B. Fernandez Avenue, which largely lies on reclaimed swampland, was generally less than that in the Perez Blvd. area except near its intersection with Rizal Street. The great degree of liquefaction along a 100m stretch of A.B. Fernandez Ave. can be traced to changes in the channel of Pantal River. Prior to north eastward expansion of Dagupan City, Pantal River used to meander around the area now partly occupied by A.B. Fernandez Ave. and Rizal St. before running parallel to Pantal Road.

Metro Manila is the political, economic, social, and cultural center of the country, and it is one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world. Metro Manila is often simply referred to as Manila, especially by non-residents, and is abbreviated as M.M.. The region is also sometimes called the Greater Manila Area, but this term usually also includes adjacent towns not strictly a part of Metro Manila.
Metro Manila is the smallest of the country's regions, but the most populous and the most densely populated, having a population of 9,932,560 (2000 census) in an area only 636 square kilometers large. It is also the only region without any provinces. The region is bordered by the provinces of Bulacan to the north, Rizal to the east, and Cavite and Laguna to the south. Metro Manila is also sandwiched by the Manila Bay to the west and the Laguna de Bay to the southeast with the Pasig River running between them, bisecting the region.
Unlike other regions which are divided into provinces, Metro Manila or the National Capital Region (NCR) is divided into four districts. These districts were created in 1976 but have no local government and no congressional representation (unlike the districts in the provinces). They are used mostly for fiscal and statistical purposes. The cities and municipalities within the NCR are grouped into the four districts as follows:
First District: Manila
Second District: Mandaluyong City, Marikina City, Pasig City, Quezon City and San Juan
Third District: Caloocan City, Malabon City, Navotas and Valenzuela City.
Fourth District: Las Piñas City, Makati City, Muntinlupa City, Parañaque City, Pasay City, Pateros and Taguig City
The term Metro Manila should not be confused with the metro rail system of the region, and the word metro itself always describes the metropolitan area (as in the metro). The railways are called by their abbreviations, such as the LRT and the MRT.Say Tayug sakey 4th class ya baley ed luyag na Pangasinan, Filipinas.

Bicol Region or Bicolandia is one of the 16 regions of the Philippines occupying the Bicol Peninsula at the southeastern end of Luzon island and some other islands.
It consists of six provinces, namely, Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes, Masbate, and Sorsogon. It has one independent chartered city, Naga City, and six component cities, Iriga City, Legazpi City, Ligao City, Masbate City, Sorsogon City, and Tabaco City. The inhabitants speak one of the Bikol languages, Masbatenyo, or a Warayan language, and the commercial/financial centers and transportation hubs are Legazpi City, the Regional Center and the Gateway City to Bicolandia, and Naga City, The Heart of Bicol and The Home of Our Lady of Peñafrancia.
The Bicol region is often seen as the epicenter of the counterculture and liberal politics in the Philippines. As many of its inhabitants seem to oppose many right-wing governments and ideology in which they blame for corruption. The region has a political reputation of being the most liberal region in the highly conservative Archipelago. It is also a stronghold for the National Democratic Front.

== Historiya ==
The town had its humble beginnings in 1770 as a farming village when it was founded by Don Mariano del Pilar de los Reyes and named it Barrio Del Pilar. It was in a productive agricultural area between the towns of San Luis in the North and Apalit in the South. As the population kept on growing in the local community, the leading citizens of the progressive village initiated a petition to consolidate a portion of the southern part of the town of San Luis and a land area from the northern part of the municipality of Apalit to form an independent municipality.
Appraised of the economic potential of a new town and confidence in the management capability of the leaders, the Spanish Governor General at the time during his second term as chief administrator of the Philippines, Don Simón de Anda y Salazar approved the official creation of the town on November 15, 1771.
The town was named in honor of the Spanish Governor General who approved its creation and of the Apostle Simon Peter, the Patron Saint of the illustrious town of Apalit. Like any other typical Spanish town (pueblo) it was administered by a “Capitan del Pueblo” and had a municipal policy making body called today as Municipal Council. The Catholic Parish Church, the Public Market, the Town Plaza and homes of prominent families were located within the proximity of the Municipal Hall. The people of San Simon celebrate two town fiestas, one in honor of Lady of the Pillar, the patron saint of the first barrio and the other in honor of the Apostle Simon Peter. In 1898, the retreating military forces of General Antonio Luna on their way to Nueva Ecija burned the parish church.
Among the early settlers of the town were the de los Reyes, de los Santos, Macapagal, Pangan, Punzalan, Puyat, Santos and Simbulan families.
In 1904, the town of San Simon was merged with the municipality of San Luis and about three years after, it became again an independent municipality. In 1920, the geographical boundaries of San Luis, Apalit and San Simon were officially established.
In 1979, through the effort and financial contributions of the Ibanez, Guevarra, Santos, Punsalan, Pangan and other families, the church was rebuilt and named as Nuestra Senora Del Pilar.


== Saray politika tan gobiyerno ==
Like other towns in the Philippines, San Simon is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head and leads the town's departments in executing the ordinances and improving public services. The vice mayor heads a legislative council (Sangguniang Bayan) consisting of councilors from the Barangays of Barrios.


=== Municipal Government ===
Just as the national government, the municipal government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative and judiciary. The judicial branch is administered solely by the Supreme Court of the Philippines. The LGUs have control of the executive and legislative branch.
The executive branch is composed of the governor for the provinces, mayor for the cities and municipalities, and the barangay captain for the barangays.Local Government Code of the Philippines, Book III, Department of Interior and Local Government official website. The legislative branch is composed of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (provincial assembly) for the provinces, Sangguniang Panlungsod (city assembly) for the cities, Sangguniang Bayan (town assembly) for the municipalities, Sangguniang Barangay (barangay council), and the Sangguniang Kabataan for the youth sector.
The seat of Government is vested upon the Mayor and other elected officers who hold office at the Town hall. The Sanguniang Bayan is the center of legislation.


=== Tanod ed Ehekutibo ===
Available records at the Municipal Hall list the following town executives from 1898 until present:


== Ekonomiya ==
The principal industries in San Simon are farming, fishing and poultry and swine industries. There are two public markets in San Simon, one in the old poblacion area and another one located in the industrial zone area.
Following the advancement of technology and industrialization, the climate for investment in San Simon is very promising because of its geographic location and the incentives initiated by Mayor Manuel S. Bondoc and the Municipal Council presided then by Vice Mayor Azor L. Sitchon. Through their effort and efficient leadership, the town with an annual gross income of about 500,000.00 Philippine pesos in 1988 as a 6th class municipality became a 4th class municipality with an annual gross income of more than 3,500,000 Philippine pesos by the end of the 20th century. When Mayor Azor L. Sitchon, an Economics graduate with honors from the famed Ateneo de Manila University took over the administration as elected mayor, he not only continued the completion of the projects and programs of his predecessor, Mayor Manuel S. Bondoc but he also initiated his own new economic programs and infrastructure projects including a modern public market and a new Municipal Hall along the national highway in barrio San Agustin (Tulauc) and made it centrally accessible from all directions. Barrio San Agustin (Tulauc) became a commercial center and the seat of municipal government, thus contributing to the increase of municipal tax revenues. Total target tax revenues from business taxes, real property taxes and other fees were projected to be more than 7,000,000.00 Philippine pesos. It is acknowledged that the significant economic growth in San Simon was brought about by the Comprehensive Municipal Development and Land Use Plan enacted by the Municipal Council. The zoning ordinance reclassified the entire stretch of Quezon Road as Industrial and Commercial Zone, but limited only to light and medium size industries and those that are environmental friendly.
Another factor that contributes to the potential economic growth of San Simon in the 21st century is its geographic location. It is strategically located in the central part of the “W” Growth Corridor of Central Luzon and it is accessible from major road networks and arteries coming from the different provinces of Central Luzon and Metro Manila. From the North Luzon Expressway, one can take an exit through the San Simon Toll Plaza, which is about 45 kilometers from Metro Manila and seven kilometers from San Fernando City, Pampanga and approximately 20 kilometers from the Clark Special Economic Zone in Angeles. City.
Taking advantage of the conducive local business environment, tax incentives and availability of skilled workers, many manufacturing and commercial firms have been established or relocated in San Simon. The infusion of private capital investment was about ten billion pesos and expected to increase to more than twenty billion pesos by the early years of the 21st century.


=== Saray karsada tan tulay ===
The national and local government of San Simon have provided transportation and bridge services to the residents. Because of the infrastracture, mango orchards and the rice industry were boosted.


== Edukasiyon ==
For elementary and high school education, residents of San Simon are served by thirteen elementary schools, two barangay public high schools, and three private schools.


== Saray panawagan ==
For telecommunications, the town is served by Digitel, PLDT, PILTEL, DATELCOM, SMART, and GLOBE. Another wireless internet service provider is COMCLARK SureStream.


== Turismo, Heritage, Relihiyon tan Kultura ==
The town is rich in its past and treasures. Its town hall and churches reveal the wealth of the town's heritage.


==== (Heritage) Church ====
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Fernando has jurisdiction over the 1771 Virgen del Pilar Parish Church.

Like most Kapampangan people, residents of San Simon retain their Kapampangan language and traditional culture and arts brought about by their Malay ancestors and enriched by Chinese, Spanish, American, Japanese and other ethnic and foreign cultures.

Europe is the world's second-smallest continent in terms of area, covering about 10 400 000 square kilometres (4,010,000 sq mi) or 2.0% of the Earth's surface. The only continent smaller than Europe is Australia. In terms of population, it is the third-largest continent (after Asia and Afrika) with a population of some 710,000,000, or about 11% of the world's population.
The European Union – comprising 25 member states, with two countries acceding in 2007 (Bulgaria and Romania) and two candidates in accession negotiations (Turkey and Croatia) – is the largest political and economic entity covering the European continent, while Russia (excluding portions in Asia) is the second largest entity and Europe's largest state in area and population.

Berikut merupakan senarai bilangan penutur bahasa Sepanyol di tempat-tempat di dunia di mana bahasa ini merupakan bahasa minoriti.

(b) hanya melibatkan penduduk berumur 5 tahun atau lebih. Selain itu, sesiapa yang menutur bahasa ini sewaktu kerja atau dalam persekitaran lain tetapi bukan di rumah tidak termasuk di sini
(c) Meskipun dijadikan sebahagian empayar Sepanyol, bahasa dan budaya Arab masih merupakan hasil kebudayaan yang dominan di Sahara Barat. Bahasa Sepanyol hanya ditutur oleh expatriat berbahasa Sepanyol dan orang berketurunan Sepanyol.
(d) Kebanyakan orang Gibraltar dapat bertutur dalam bahasa Inggeris dan Sepanyol kerana kedekatan wilayah British Gibraltar kepada negara Sepanyol. Meskipun kedua-dua bahasa ini paling banyak ditutur penduduk wilayah berkenaan (bersama-sama bahasa gabungannya Llanito), bahasa Inggeris masih merupakan satu-satunya bahasa rasmi di Gibraltar.

Europe is the world's second-smallest continent in terms of area, covering about 10 400 000 square kilometres (4,010,000 sq mi) or 2.0% of the Earth's surface. The only continent smaller than Europe is Australia. In terms of population, it is the third-largest continent (after Asia and Afrika) with a population of some 710,000,000, or about 11% of the world's population.
The European Union – comprising 25 member states, with two countries acceding in 2007 (Bulgaria and Romania) and two candidates in accession negotiations (Turkey and Croatia) – is the largest political and economic entity covering the European continent, while Russia (excluding portions in Asia) is the second largest entity and Europe's largest state in area and population.

Say Las Piñas sakey siyudad diad Pilipino ed Metro Manila.


== Say siyudad ==
Since its establishment as a small fishing port and a major salt-making center during the Spanish Era, Las Piñas has grown into an important residential, commercial and industrial suburb of Metro Manila.
Las Piñas is famous for its Bamboo Organ, located inside the St. Joseph Church of the Parish of Las Piñas, formerly known as San Jose Parish Church in the Spanish Period, as the only organ of its kind in the world. Built in 1824 by Catholic priest, Fr. Diego Cera, created out of bamboo, wood, and metal, this famous organ is praised for its unique, rare, and melodious sound.
The Sarao Motors factory is also located in Las Piñas, the place where Jeepneys are assembled piece by piece in painstaking individual production. The factory remains open to buyers and curious visitors all year round.
Las Piñas has a large shopping mall named SM Southmall, which has an area of 205,120 square meters and is located along Alabang–Zapote Road. The newest shopping mall development in the city is SM Center Las Piñas, located few meters away from the City Hall. The first high rise building in the city is 16 story residential building Almanza Metropolis.
Las Piñas, also known as one of the cleanest cities in Metro Manila, is in the list of the "Clean and Green Hall of Fame" awarded by the Philippine Government. It is also the first local government unit in the Philippines that has been honored with the prestigious Global 500 Roll of Honour of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). These honors were in recognition of the city's outstanding achievements in the protection and improvement of the environment.
Las Piñas has recently acquired the status "Most Competitive City" in the Philippines, together with Davao City, Sekano (Makati), Muntinlupa and Marikina.


== Historiya ==
Las Piñas was one of the earliest fishing settlements on the shores of Manila Bay and was proclaimed a town either in 1762 or 1797. Its exact date of creation cannot be ascertained because historical records vary. Cavada, a Spanish historian and Fr. Juan Medina placed it at 1762, while Buzeta recorded the date at 1797.
Besides being famous for its Bamboo Organ, which was built by Fr. Diego Cera and completed in 1824, the town of Las Piñas was also a major war theater during the 1896 Philippine Revolution, as it was occupied by Gen. Emilio Aquinaldo's forces. Las Piñas was also, occupied by the Japanese during Second World War, to be followed by the liberation period, when the combined Filipino and American forces fought the Japanese Imperial armed forces until the end of war.
In 1901, the Municipality of Las Piñas was incorporated from Cavite to the newly created province of Rizal pursuant to Philippine Commission Act No. 137. Two years later, it was combined with Parañaque, the latter being the seat of a new municipal government.
It became a separate municipality from Parañaque on March 27, 1907 by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 1625. Then, with the founding of the Metropolitan Manila Area (Metro Manila in short) in 1976, Las Piñas became one of the municipalities making up the region.
On February 12, 1997, President Fidel Ramos signed the bill declaring Las Piñas a new city. A plebiscite held a month after found the residents in approval of cityhood and Las Piñas became the 10th city of Metro Manila on March 26, 1997.


== Gobiyerno ==
Las Piñas, like other cities of the Philippines, is a local government unit whose powers and functions are specified by the Local Government Code of the Philippines. In general, as a city, Las Piñas is headed by a mayor who heads the city's executive function and the vice mayor who heads the city's legislative function, which is composed of twelve councilors, six each from the city's two city council districts. For representation, the city is considered as one district, and therefore one representative, in the country's House of Representatives.
Additionally, like other cities and municipalities, Las Piñas is subdivided into barangays.

== Historiya ==


=== Ed walay pa ed saray Kastila ===
Mauswagong kabalayan na ang Sugbo mga tulo ka libo ka tuig kaniadto sa pa sakopa sa Espanya. Nakigbinayloay kini sa China ug uban pang kanasuran sa sidlakang-habagatang Asya.


=== Pag-abot so sakey Kastila ===
Miabot si Fernando de Magallanes sa Sugbo niadtong Abril 7, 1521. Gidawat sila isip mga dumuduong ni Radja Humabon nga kauban sa iyang asawa ug walo ka gatos nila ka sakop gipamunyagan sa mga Kachila niadtong Abril 14 isip mga unang Pilipinhong Katoliko. Apan pakyas hinuon si Magallano sa pag-ankon sa kapupud-ang Pilipinhon isip katigayonan sa hari sa Espanya sanglit napatay man siya ni Ka Lapulapu didto sa pulo sa Mactan pagka Abril 27 niadtong tuiga.
Abril 27, 1565, midunggo sa Sugbo si Miguel Lopez de Legazpi kuyog ang Agustinhong pareng si Andres de Urdaneta. Gisalid-an ni Legazpi ang ngalan sa dakbayan gikan sa San Miguel ngadto sa Villa del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus. Sulod sa unom ka tuig ang Sugbo maoy kaulohan sa bag-ong gitukod nga kolonya sa Espanya.
Gimugna ang lalawigan sa Sugbo ubos sa Act No. 2711 niadtong Marso 10, 1917. Mao kini ang natawhang lalawigan ni Sergio Osmeña, Sr. ang misunod pagkapangulo sa Commonwealth human ni Manuel L. Quezon panahon sa Ikaduhang Gubat sa Tibuok Kalibutan.
Ang lalawigan sa Sugbo ilabi na ang dakbayan sa Sugbo nakatagamtam og pagsaka sa international investments sa naunang bahin sa dekada 1990, diin namugna ang terminong CEBOOM isip tawag adtong pasakaha sa ekonomiya.

Sagor na Baybay na Luzon Region (Northwestern Luzon Region) or Region 1 of the Philippines is located in the northwestern part of Luzon. It is bounded by Cordillera Administrative Region and Cagayan Valley to the east, Central Luzon to the south and by the South China Sea to the west.
The region is composed of four provinces, namely: Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union and Pangasinan. Its regional center is San Fernando City, La Union. The region is occupied 70% by Ilocanos and 28% by Pangasinenses.
Although the Philippine government designated Region 1 as the Ilocos Region, many people find the designated name of the region as ethno-centric. Many people find the name Northwestern Region, which is geographically deduced, as the more appropriate term.


== People and culture ==
The Ilocos provinces of Region 1 is the historical homeland of the Ilocanos. The Ilocanos have the following percentage of the population inside the bracket in each province: Pangasinan (43%), La Union (92%), Ilocos Norte (97%), and Ilocos Sur (93%). Pangasinan is the historical homeland of the Pangasinenses. The population of Pangasinan composed around 60% of the whole population of the region. The Pangasinenses presently constitute around 50% of the population of the province. The province was not originally part of the Region 1. It was only during the time of President Marcos, when Pangasinan was included in the province. Minority groups include the Tingguian and Isneg communities that inhabit the foothills of the Cordillera mountains.
The population is predominantly Roman Catholic with strong adherents of Protestantism such as the Aglipayan denomination further north of the country. There is also an undercurrent of traditional animistic beliefs especially in rural areas. The small mercantile Chinese and Indian communities are primarily Buddhists and Hindus respectively


== Economy ==
Although the economy in the southern portion of the region, esp. Pangasinan, is anchored in agro-industial and service industry, the economy in the northern portion of the region is anchored in the agricultural sector. The economy in Pangasinan is driven by agro-industrial businesses, such as milkfish (bangus) cultivation and processing, livestock raising, fish paste processing (bagoong), and others. At the same time the importance of trading, financial services, and educational services in the economy cannot be denied. Income in the northern portion mostly come from cultivating rice, tobacco, corn, sugarcane, and fruits; raising livestock such as pigs, chicken, goats, and carabaos (water buffalos).
The distribution of the economic activity in the region may be seen from the collection of tax revenue of the national government. According to the data from the Statistical Coordination Board, the bulk of the collections come from Pangasinan, which posted 61% of the total.
The service and light manufacturing industries are concentrated in the cities. Dagupan City is mostly driven by its local entrepreneurs, which have started to expand its network up to the national level. San Fernando City in La Union also has an active shipping port and Laoag City in Ilocos Norte has a growing international airport. The government is one of the largest employers along with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola.
The tourism industry focuses on the coastal beaches and on eco-tourism. There are fine sands stretching along Bauang, La Union and the rest of the region. Opportunities to engage in other water sports and activities abound. Eco-tourism takes advantage of the marine and forest resources in the region and displays the natural beauty of the Ilocos.
The region is also rich in crafts, with renowned blanket-weaving and pottery. Their burnay pottery is well known for its dark colored clay.


== Political Division ==
Region 1 is composed of 4 provinces and a total of 9 cities.


==== Component Cities ====
Alaminos City, Pangasinan
Siyudad na Candon, Ilocos Sur
Dagupan City , Pangasinan
Laoag City, Ilocos Norte
Urdaneta City, Pangasinan
Siyudad na San Carlos, Pangasinan
Siyudad na San Fernando, La Union
Siyudad na Vigan, Ilocos Sur


=== Physical ===
Region 1 occupies the narrow plain between the Cordillera Central mountain range and the South China Sea. It also occupies the northern portion of the Central Luzon plain, to the northeast of the Zambales Mountains.
Lingayen Gulf is the most notable body of water in the region and it contains a number of islands, including the Hundred Islands National Park. To the north of the region is Luzon Strait.
The Agno river runs through Pangasinan and empties into Lingayen Gulf. The river flow into a broad delta in the vicinity of Lingayen and Dagupan City.


== Tourist Attractions ==
Hundred Islands National Park. Located in the Lingayen Gulf in Pangasinan, the watery park is dotted by 123 small, pristine islands. Three islands have been developed for tourists.
Vigan colonial houses. Vigan City is famous for its cobblestone streets and Spanish-style houses, an architectural remnant of its colonial past. The Mestizo District displays mansions typical of the era. They were owned by prominent Ilocano-Chinese merchant families of that time, hence mestizo or "mixed race."
Ancient churches. The region is dotted by old Catholic churches built by natives for the Spanish. Famous churches can be found in Vigan City, once the seat of the Bishop of Nueva Segovia, and in Manaoag, Pangasinan.


== History ==
Region 1 was first inhabited by the aboriginal Negritos before they were pushed by successive waves of Malay immigrants that penetrated the narrow coast. Tingguians in the interior, Ilocanos in the north, and Pangasinense in the south settled the region.
The Spanish arrived in the 16th century and established Christian missions and governmental institutions to control the native population and convert them to the Roman Catholic church. Present-day Vigan City in Ilocos Sur province became the bishopric seat of Nueva Segovia. Proud Ilocanos in the northern parts were less easily swayed, however, and remained an area filled with deep resentments against Spain. These resentments bubbled to the surface at various points in the region's history as insurrections. According to Nick Joaquin in his book Culture and History, the Pangasinenses were the last to be stand against the Spaniards.
The most notable of the rebellions were that of Andres Malong and Palaris of Pangasinan,Diego Silang and his wife Gabriela Silang in 1764, and the Basi Revolt in the 19th century.
In 1901, the region went under American colonial rule, and in 1941, under Japanese occupation.
Several modern presidents of the Republic of the Philippines hailed from the Region: Elpidio Quirino, Ferdinand Marcos, and Fidel Ramos.
Before the Cordillera Administrative Region was formed, Region 1 also included the provinces of Abra, Mountain Province, and Benguet.Say Filipinas or Say Philippines (English: Philippines; Filipino: Pilipinas), tatawagen a Republika na Filipinas (English: Republic of the Philippines; Filipino: Republika ng Pilipinas), sakey a bansan kapuloan a nipasen ed kapuloan Malay ed Southeast Asia, a say capital to so Manila.

Bicol Region or Bicolandia is one of the 16 regions of the Philippines occupying the Bicol Peninsula at the southeastern end of Luzon island and some other islands.
It consists of six provinces, namely, Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes, Masbate, and Sorsogon. It has one independent chartered city, Naga City, and six component cities, Iriga City, Legazpi City, Ligao City, Masbate City, Sorsogon City, and Tabaco City. The inhabitants speak one of the Bikol languages, Masbatenyo, or a Warayan language, and the commercial/financial centers and transportation hubs are Legazpi City, the Regional Center and the Gateway City to Bicolandia, and Naga City, The Heart of Bicol and The Home of Our Lady of Peñafrancia.
The Bicol region is often seen as the epicenter of the counterculture and liberal politics in the Philippines. As many of its inhabitants seem to oppose many right-wing governments and ideology in which they blame for corruption. The region has a political reputation of being the most liberal region in the highly conservative Archipelago. It is also a stronghold for the National Democratic Front.

== Juan 3:16 ==
Matatagpuan sa Juan 3:16 o Kabanata 3, taludtod bilang 16 ng Ebanghelyo ni Juan ng Bibliyang Kristiano ang pariralang bugtong na Anak. Ito ang taludturan o bersong tinawag na ang "Mabuting Balita sa loob ng isang balat ng mani" dahil naglalaman ito ng kabuuran ng isa sa pinakamahalagang mga panuntunan o doktrina ng Kristianismo, na nilalahad ng paganito batay sa Bibliyang Tagalog na salin ni Amado Espino, gobernador ng lalawigan ng Pangasinan:

Ta ontan la’y impangara na Dios ed mondo, ya inter to so bogbogtong ya Anak to, pian sio-paman á manisia ed sikato agnatawtaw, no ag wala so bilay to’n andi angaan.
– Juan 3:16 Pangasinense (Gobernador Amado Espino)

Oo, gayon na lamang ang pagmamahal ng Diyos sa daigdig kaya ibinigay niya ang kanyang bugtong na Anak upang ang lahat ng mga sumasampalataya sa kanya ay huwag mapahamak kundi bagkus magkamit ng buhay na walang hanggan.
– Juan 3:16 (Abriol)

Lubos na iniibig ng Diyos ang sanlibutan kaya ipinagkaloob niya ang kaniyang bugtong na anak upang ang sinumang sumampalataya sa kaniya ay hindi mapahamak kundi magkaroon ng buhay na walang hanggan.
– Juan 3:16 (JH/HB)

Gayon na lamang ang pag-ibig ng Diyos sa sanlibutan kaya ipinagkaloob niya ang kaniyang bugtong na Anak upang ang sinumang sumampalataya sa kaniya ay hindi mapahamak kundi magkaroon ng buhay na walang hanggan.
– Juan 3:16 (TBW/Biblista)

Sapagkat gayon na lamang ang pag-ibig ng Diyos sa sangkatauhan, kaya't ibinigay niya ang kanyang kaisa-isang Anak, upang ang sinumang sumampalataya sa kanya ay hindi mapahamak, kundi magkaroon ng buhay na walang hanggan.
– Juan 3:16 (BMBB/AngBiblia.net)

Sapagka't gayon na lamang ang pagsinta ng Dios sa sanglibutan, na ibinigay niya ang kaniyang bugtong na Anak, upang ang sinomang sa kaniya'y sumampalataya ay huwag mapahamak, kundi magkaroon ng buhay na walang hanggan.
– Juan 3:16 (Say Sigud ya Biblia, 1905)

Gayon na lamang ang pag-ibig ng Dios sa sanlibutan, na ipinagkaloob niya ang kanyang bugtong na Anak, upang ang sinumang sa kanya'y sumampalataya ay hindi dapat mapahamak, kundi magkaroon ng buhay na walang hanggan.
– Juan 3:16 (Mayor Carolyn Grace's Bible in Puerto Galera)

Say Las Piñas sakey siyudad diad Pilipino ed Metro Manila.


== Say siyudad ==
Since its establishment as a small fishing port and a major salt-making center during the Spanish Era, Las Piñas has grown into an important residential, commercial and industrial suburb of Metro Manila.
Las Piñas is famous for its Bamboo Organ, located inside the St. Joseph Church of the Parish of Las Piñas, formerly known as San Jose Parish Church in the Spanish Period, as the only organ of its kind in the world. Built in 1824 by Catholic priest, Fr. Diego Cera, created out of bamboo, wood, and metal, this famous organ is praised for its unique, rare, and melodious sound.
The Sarao Motors factory is also located in Las Piñas, the place where Jeepneys are assembled piece by piece in painstaking individual production. The factory remains open to buyers and curious visitors all year round.
Las Piñas has a large shopping mall named SM Southmall, which has an area of 205,120 square meters and is located along Alabang–Zapote Road. The newest shopping mall development in the city is SM Center Las Piñas, located few meters away from the City Hall. The first high rise building in the city is 16 story residential building Almanza Metropolis.
Las Piñas, also known as one of the cleanest cities in Metro Manila, is in the list of the "Clean and Green Hall of Fame" awarded by the Philippine Government. It is also the first local government unit in the Philippines that has been honored with the prestigious Global 500 Roll of Honour of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). These honors were in recognition of the city's outstanding achievements in the protection and improvement of the environment.
Las Piñas has recently acquired the status "Most Competitive City" in the Philippines, together with Davao City, Sekano (Makati), Muntinlupa and Marikina.


== Historiya ==
Las Piñas was one of the earliest fishing settlements on the shores of Manila Bay and was proclaimed a town either in 1762 or 1797. Its exact date of creation cannot be ascertained because historical records vary. Cavada, a Spanish historian and Fr. Juan Medina placed it at 1762, while Buzeta recorded the date at 1797.
Besides being famous for its Bamboo Organ, which was built by Fr. Diego Cera and completed in 1824, the town of Las Piñas was also a major war theater during the 1896 Philippine Revolution, as it was occupied by Gen. Emilio Aquinaldo's forces. Las Piñas was also, occupied by the Japanese during Second World War, to be followed by the liberation period, when the combined Filipino and American forces fought the Japanese Imperial armed forces until the end of war.
In 1901, the Municipality of Las Piñas was incorporated from Cavite to the newly created province of Rizal pursuant to Philippine Commission Act No. 137. Two years later, it was combined with Parañaque, the latter being the seat of a new municipal government.
It became a separate municipality from Parañaque on March 27, 1907 by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 1625. Then, with the founding of the Metropolitan Manila Area (Metro Manila in short) in 1976, Las Piñas became one of the municipalities making up the region.
On February 12, 1997, President Fidel Ramos signed the bill declaring Las Piñas a new city. A plebiscite held a month after found the residents in approval of cityhood and Las Piñas became the 10th city of Metro Manila on March 26, 1997.

Say Las Piñas sakey siyudad diad Pilipino ed Metro Manila.


== Say siyudad ==
Since its establishment as a small fishing port and a major salt-making center during the Spanish Era, Las Piñas has grown into an important residential, commercial and industrial suburb of Metro Manila.
Las Piñas is famous for its Bamboo Organ, located inside the St. Joseph Church of the Parish of Las Piñas, formerly known as San Jose Parish Church in the Spanish Period, as the only organ of its kind in the world. Built in 1824 by Catholic priest, Fr. Diego Cera, created out of bamboo, wood, and metal, this famous organ is praised for its unique, rare, and melodious sound.
The Sarao Motors factory is also located in Las Piñas, the place where Jeepneys are assembled piece by piece in painstaking individual production. The factory remains open to buyers and curious visitors all year round.
Las Piñas has a large shopping mall named SM Southmall, which has an area of 205,120 square meters and is located along Alabang–Zapote Road. The newest shopping mall development in the city is SM Center Las Piñas, located few meters away from the City Hall. The first high rise building in the city is 16 story residential building Almanza Metropolis.
Las Piñas, also known as one of the cleanest cities in Metro Manila, is in the list of the "Clean and Green Hall of Fame" awarded by the Philippine Government. It is also the first local government unit in the Philippines that has been honored with the prestigious Global 500 Roll of Honour of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). These honors were in recognition of the city's outstanding achievements in the protection and improvement of the environment.
Las Piñas has recently acquired the status "Most Competitive City" in the Philippines, together with Davao City, Sekano (Makati), Muntinlupa and Marikina.


== Historiya ==
Las Piñas was one of the earliest fishing settlements on the shores of Manila Bay and was proclaimed a town either in 1762 or 1797. Its exact date of creation cannot be ascertained because historical records vary. Cavada, a Spanish historian and Fr. Juan Medina placed it at 1762, while Buzeta recorded the date at 1797.
Besides being famous for its Bamboo Organ, which was built by Fr. Diego Cera and completed in 1824, the town of Las Piñas was also a major war theater during the 1896 Philippine Revolution, as it was occupied by Gen. Emilio Aquinaldo's forces. Las Piñas was also, occupied by the Japanese during Second World War, to be followed by the liberation period, when the combined Filipino and American forces fought the Japanese Imperial armed forces until the end of war.
In 1901, the Municipality of Las Piñas was incorporated from Cavite to the newly created province of Rizal pursuant to Philippine Commission Act No. 137. Two years later, it was combined with Parañaque, the latter being the seat of a new municipal government.
It became a separate municipality from Parañaque on March 27, 1907 by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 1625. Then, with the founding of the Metropolitan Manila Area (Metro Manila in short) in 1976, Las Piñas became one of the municipalities making up the region.
On February 12, 1997, President Fidel Ramos signed the bill declaring Las Piñas a new city. A plebiscite held a month after found the residents in approval of cityhood and Las Piñas became the 10th city of Metro Manila on March 26, 1997.


== Gobiyerno ==
Las Piñas, like other cities of the Philippines, is a local government unit whose powers and functions are specified by the Local Government Code of the Philippines. In general, as a city, Las Piñas is headed by a mayor who heads the city's executive function and the vice mayor who heads the city's legislative function, which is composed of twelve councilors, six each from the city's two city council districts. For representation, the city is considered as one district, and therefore one representative, in the country's House of Representatives.

== Hiyograpiko ==
Trece Martires City is strategically located in the heart of the Province of Cavite. It is bounded by Tanza town to the north and west, Naic also to the west, Amadeo and Indang to the south, and General Trias to the east. It is located about Template:Convert from Manila, the capital of the Philippines, or about an hour by car.


== Historiya ==
Trece Martires started as one of the largest and remotest barrios in Cavite. It was originally named Quinta or Quintana and was part of the municipality of Tanza, Cavite. The land was basically agricultural subdivided into cattle ranches and sugar farms, with less than one thousand hectares, located at the intersection of the Tanza-Indang Road and the present Naic-Dasmariñas Road in the province.
The city was established on May 24, 1954 under Republic Act No. 981 entitled "The Charter of Trece Martires City" as approved by President Ramón Magsaysay. The Republic Act also transferred the capital of the province from Cavite City to Trece Martires. The original bill, House Bill 1795, was authored by Congressman Jose T. Cajulis (1954–1957) and Senator Justiniano S. Montano (1949–1956).
Under the city charter, the Governor of the province is the ex-officio city mayor of Trece Martires City thus making then Governor Dominador Mangubat as the city's first chief executive. On January 2, 1956, the provincial capitol was formally inaugurated, the same day the newly-elected governor, Delfin N. Montano, the son of Senator Justiniano Montano, was sworn into office. He served as governor and mayor of Trece Martires from 1956 to 1971.
On June 22, 1957 the original act was amended by Republic Act 1912 increasing its territory to 3917 hectares, more or less. Consequently, the municipalities of Indang and General Trias had to yield parts of their respective areas to this territorial expansion.
Former President Ferdinand Marcos signed Presidential Decree No. 1163 relocating the capital and seat of government from Trece Martires to Imus City. Governor Juanito Victor C. Remulla requested Marcos in September 1979 to transfer the capital back to Trece Martires City. As of 2012, the provincial capital is still Imus City, but most of the provincial offices are still located in Trece Martires City.
On March 31, 1992, the Republic Act no. 7325 was approved by President Corazon Aquino amending the charter of Trece Martires City, allowing the city to vote their own local officials for the first time.

Say Dagupan City (salitan Pangasinan: Siyudad na Dagupan) sakey 3rd class siyudad ed luyag na Pangasinan, Filipinas. Onong ed 2000 census, walay population to ya 130,328 ya too diad 25,921 ya pamilya. According to the same survey, Pangasinan is the most populous province in the Philippines. Located on Lingayen Gulf on the island of Luzon, Dagupan is the chief port and commercial and financial center of the province and Northern Luzon; an active trade is conducted in sugarcane, corn, rice, copra, salt, and an alcoholic liquor produced from the nipa palm. The city is known as the Bangus (milkfish) capital of the Philippines because of its abundance of fresh bangus.
The longest barbecue measured 1,007.56 m (3,305.64 ft) - it was created by the people of Dagupan City on May 3, 2003 as part of the city’s Bangus Festival.


== Geography ==


== History ==


=== Pre-Hispanic times ===
Pangasinan in the 16th century, they found that Lingayen Gulf was already a prosperous entrepot visited by traders from other Asian countries. The Augustinian missionary Juan de la Concepcion noted that the communities at Lingayen, Bolinao and the defunct Binalatongan exercised authority over other communities (called baley in the Pangasinan language) in the area. De la Concepcion also mentioned several other towns but did not identify them.


=== Spanish colonial period ===
The area that is now known as Dagupan was described as marshland thickly covered with mangrove and nipa palm trees. The natives lived along the shoreline and riverbanks of Calmay, Pantal, and Bonuan. But there were also communities in Malaued, Lasip, Pogo, and Bacayao. The natives called the area Bacnotan which would later be incorporated into the encomienda of Lingayen that was established in 1583.
The foreign traders would come to the Lingayen coast to trade gold that was brought down to the area by tribesmen in the Cordillera Mountains. Aside from traders, Filipinos also had experience with pirates from Japan and China. One of the Chinese corsairs was Lim Feng (in Fukienese, Lim A-hong), who would be known in Philippine history as Limahong.
Limahong sailed down the Ilocos coast with 62 ships and attacked Manila on Nov. 30, 1574. The Spanish, however, repulsed Limahong's two attacks. The Chinese corsair repaired to Pangasinan to establish a colony at Bacnotan on December 2, 1574. But the Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo laid siege on his fortress for eight months by blocking the river outlets. Limahong puportedly broke through the siege by digging a channel from the Agno River through the Bacnotan marshes to Lingayen Gulf
In 1661, a big fire hit Bacnotan during the Malong Revolt, led by Andres Malong of Binalatongan, against the forced labor and mandatory sale of local goods imposed by the Spanish colonial government. The fire broke out after Malong sent 3,000 supporters, most of whom were Zambal tribesmen, to Ilocos and Cagayan to fight the Spaniards. The people of Bacnotan, many of whom joined the Spanish in repelling the Zambal marauders, rebuilt the town and renamed it Nandaragupan, meaning where once stood the commercial center, indicating its early importance as a trade, commercial and political center in the region. In 1720, Nandaragupan was chartered as a town but its name was simplified to Dagupan. Malong was eventually beheaded in the city's Pantal bridge in 1661 by Spanish authorities.
Dagupan was also the birthplace of a ladino named Caragay who led another uprising in 1719 against the provincial governor (alcalde mayor, in Spanish) who had him flogged for what appeared to be a false accusation of smuggling. Governor Antonio del Valle had Caragay arrested in the village of Nantagalan, northeast of San Jacinto and Mangaldan and flogged. Vowing vengeance, Caragay organized a band of men who hounded the governor until they were able to kill him. Historians view Caragay as a "model" of the revolts of Palaris and Diego Silang. More than Malong, historians view Caragay as a "model" of the revolts of Palaris and Diego Silang. In 1762, Dagupan would be one of the first towns to join the Palaris Revolt against Spain.
In 1780, Pantal, originally named Pantalan (port), became a trading center and docking station for merchant ships. At about the same time, the bangus industry thrived and mangrove swamps were converted into fishponds, starting the land conversions that would later have an impact on flooding and earthquake damage in the province. The opening of the Pantalan dock eased the transportation of goods from Pangasinan to other parts of the country, spurring the cultivation of idle lands in the eastern part and the development of fishponds in the western part of the province. The new dock also eased communications between the colonial government, its soldiers and the missionaries, who were tasked to colonize the natives in the Cordillera Mountains and the Cagayan Valley region and exploit its gold deposits.
In July 1787, the Spanish began to build a road to connect Pangasinan and the Cagayan Valley, the home of several head-hunting tribesmen who refused to submit to Spanish rule. Although it took several years to complete, the road would play a vital role in the colonization of the Cagayan Valley and the Cordillera Mountains.
The Palaris and Silang revolts, which occurred simultaneously with the British Invasion of the Philippines demonstrated to the Spaniards the importance of ports in Pangasin and Ilocos to the security of the entire island of Luzon. They thus became centers of Spanish governance and acculturation in the 19th century. When the port of Manila was opened to foreign trade in 1830, tobacco from Pangasinan and Cagayan Valley were shipped to the colonial capital via Dagupan and Lingayen. Foreign trading agents also began to make appearances in the two towns, starting a new era of prosperity, especially for the provincial gentry.
The Filipino scholar Maximo Kalaw found the description of the American writer David Barrows as appropriate:
The Filipino had now become embarked upon a new current of intellectual experience -- a course of enlightenment which has been so full of unexpected development... Throughout the islands a class was rapidly growing up to which the new industries had brought wealth. Their means enabled them to build spacious and splendid homes of the fine hardwoods of the Philippines, and to surround themselves with such luxuries as the life of the islands permitted. This class was rapidly gaining education.
This was also true of the Dagupan gentry. Trade enriched many families and allowed them to send their scions to study overseas. These young men returned to the Philippines not only with technical knowledge in their chosen fields but also with the intellectual currents of the time, including constitutional republicanism which swept Spain in 1810.
News from the colonial government in Manila also reached Dagupan at a faster pace with the completion of the Manila-Dagupan Railway in 1891. The railway would play a significant role not only in the economic development of Pangasinan but also in the success of the Philippine Revolution.


=== Under the First Philippine Republic ===
Not much is known of Dagupeños involvement in the Katipunan and the first and second parts of the Philippine Revolution. But on Mar. 7, 1898, the Dagupeños unveiled a coordinated attack on Spanish forces that appears to have been planned months in advance. It is now known as the Battle of Dagupan (1898)
The Dagupeño leaders of the attack were Juan Solis Galvan, Teodoro Villamil, Pedro de Venecia, Macario Meneses and Daniel Maramba. They were under the overall command of Francisco Macabulos, who had just liberated the provinces of Pampanga and Tarlac. He was assisted by Ramon Manalang, who was based in Alaminos. Communications between Macabulos and Manalang was coordinated by Macario Meneses of Bonuan.
The Spanish forces were commanded by Federico Caballos, who had troops garrisoned at all the towns of Pangasinan. In Dagupan, he had men at the Colegio de San Alberto Magno, which guarded the western approach to the town; at the foot of Quintos Bridge, which guarded the east; and his main force at the Catholic Church.
Although the revolutionary forces were ill equipped (most of them armed only with bolos and lances), they attacked the Spanish with an ingenious rolling trench. The "trenches" were made of several banana tree trunks, wrapped in sheets of dried nipa palm leaves. The trenches were seven feet in diameter and the revolutionists would roll the it toward Spanish positions so they could fight them in close quarter with their bolos and lances.
Galvan led the back at the Colegio de San Alberto Magno while Villamil and De Venecia swooped down on the enemies at Quintos Bridge. The Tagalog forces from Nueva Ecija, who were better armed, joined the Dagupeños who attacked the Spanish position at the church. The Dagupeños held the Spanish troops at bay in Dagupan while other revolutionists liberated other towns in the province. Maramba later joined the battle after fighting in Sta. Barbara and Mangaldan.
By July 21, after four months and 16 days, Macabulos unleashed a concerted attack. The Spanish and Filipino troops exchanged fire for two nights and a day before Caballos surrendered on July 23 1898, six weeks after the Declaration of Philippine Independence on June 12, 1898.
After the town returned to normal, President Emilio Aguinaldo named Galvan president of the municipal council. Galvan was a ranking officer of the Katipunan. Galvan Street along which the public market was built was named after him.


=== American colonial period ===
On January 8-9, 1945, U.S. General Douglas MacArthur landed his amphibious liberation force in the city's "Blue Beach" section along the Lingayen Gulf. From his beachhead in Dagupan, along with those in neighboring towns Lingayen and San Fabian, MacArthur's forces under General Walter Krueger were able to penetrate Japanese defenses in Luzon island and liberate Filipino and allied prisoners of war in Manila's University of Sto. Tomas.


=== Dagupan becomes a city ===
Dagupan became a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 170, authored by Speaker Eugenio Perez. It was signed into law by President Manuel Roxas on June 20, 1947.
On October 15, 1947, President Roxas issued Executive Order No. 96 fixing the city limits to include the towns of San Fabian, Pangasinan and Calasiao, Pangasinan but the residents of Calasiao rejected inclusion into the new city, causing controversy over the election that was held on Nov. 10, 1947.
The dispute was brought before the Supreme Court of the Philippines which subsequently validated the election and ruled that Dagupan became a city on June 20, 1947, when Roxas signed the charter into law.
Despite the controversy attending Dagupan's rise as a city, the new city mayor, Angel B. Fernandez, embarked on an infrastructure program that would develop erswhile idle swamplands toward the south and west.
In 1948, he built a road from barrio Mayombo to barrio Tapuac, passing through the edge of barrio Pogo Chico. The road, built mostly on reclaimed swampland, was named Perez Boulevard, in honor of Dagupan's first lawyer and Assemblyman Rodrigo Perez. The road was needed because of the increasing number of commercial establishments on Torres Bugallon Avenue and the growing number of residents at the southern limits of the city. In 1946, the Dagupan City High School was transferred from Torres Bugallon Avenue. Perez Boulevard expanded the commercial area south especially after Fernandez built a new public market at the bank of the river.
Later, Fernandez's successor Teofilo Guadiz, who served from 1954-1957 and 1958-1959, would also contribute to the city's expansion by extending Rizal Street, which was only then from Torres Bugallon to Rivera Street, up to the Iglesia ni Cristo compound. Also, he extended Galvan Street, which was then up to Gomez Street only, up to Perez Boulevard. He also secured funds from Senator Cipriano P. Primicias Sr., a native of Pangasinan, to build a two-story semi-permanent building for the city high school. Guadiz also replaced the Bailey bridge on Perez Boulevard with a concrete one.
The westward expansion of the city went as far as Lucao which was also swampland. Local historian Restituto Basa surmised that the name Lucao may have been derived from the shellfish called lukan that used to abound in the swampy area.
In June 1962, Dagupan was shaken by a series of strong earthquakes which occurred at irregular intervals for about three weeks. The quakes toppled the belfry of the Roman Catholic Church. The epicenter of the earthquake was in Calmay, where real estate values dropped after the temblors. Many people from Calmay, Carael and island barrios evacuated to other towns.
In 1968, the national government agencies opened offices in Dagupan and other key cities across the country. The daytime population increased sustantially, causing congestion in the city that began to see the appearance of public utility tricycles.
On July 16, 1990, an magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck northern Luzon. The worst hit cities were Cabanatuan, Baguio and Dagupan.
Many public and private structures were destroyed or damaged when river banks slid into the Pantal River and dry land into the swampy areas. Streets were ruptured and the ground subsided, causing buildings to sink by as much as two meters. Other buildings tilted severely, especially along Perez Boulevard. One building tilted by as much as 19 degrees, but generally, the magnitude of tilt was within 2-5 degrees.
There were sand boils in several areas in the city and drainage systems were clogged by the accumulated sand causing temporary flooding of the city's main thoroughfares. Some houses remained underwater by 30-50 cms. for several months. The whole stretch of Don Jose Calimlim Street and swampy areas and fishpond communities, such as Barangay Lasip Grande, remained underwater even during low tide conditions.

At the height of the earthquake, an eyewitness told experts of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology that he saw rolling during the earthquake and a jeep parked along the road vanished from his sight.
Scientists blamed the destruction on the liquefaction of land that was had not compacted enough since it was reclaimed from the swamp or marsh. It was also blamed on the active shifting of Pantal River, which left abandoned meanders on which people built structures. Varying degrees of damage were sustained in the different affected areas of Dagupan City. Phivolcs said a study of the damage during the earthquake indicate that susceptibility to liquefaction in different parts of Dagupan City can be related to the relative ages of the geologic features and the deposits underlying them.
The degree of destruction along A.B. Fernandez Avenue, which largely lies on reclaimed swampland, was generally less than that in the Perez Blvd. area except near its intersection with Rizal Street. The great degree of liquefaction along a 100m stretch of A.B. Fernandez Ave. can be traced to changes in the channel of Pantal River. Prior to north eastward expansion of Dagupan City, Pantal River used to meander around the area now partly occupied by A.B. Fernandez Ave. and Rizal St. before running parallel to Pantal Road.

Say Las Piñas sakey siyudad diad Pilipino ed Metro Manila.


== Say siyudad ==
Since its establishment as a small fishing port and a major salt-making center during the Spanish Era, Las Piñas has grown into an important residential, commercial and industrial suburb of Metro Manila.
Las Piñas is famous for its Bamboo Organ, located inside the St. Joseph Church of the Parish of Las Piñas, formerly known as San Jose Parish Church in the Spanish Period, as the only organ of its kind in the world. Built in 1824 by Catholic priest, Fr. Diego Cera, created out of bamboo, wood, and metal, this famous organ is praised for its unique, rare, and melodious sound.
The Sarao Motors factory is also located in Las Piñas, the place where Jeepneys are assembled piece by piece in painstaking individual production. The factory remains open to buyers and curious visitors all year round.
Las Piñas has a large shopping mall named SM Southmall, which has an area of 205,120 square meters and is located along Alabang–Zapote Road. The newest shopping mall development in the city is SM Center Las Piñas, located few meters away from the City Hall. The first high rise building in the city is 16 story residential building Almanza Metropolis.
Las Piñas, also known as one of the cleanest cities in Metro Manila, is in the list of the "Clean and Green Hall of Fame" awarded by the Philippine Government. It is also the first local government unit in the Philippines that has been honored with the prestigious Global 500 Roll of Honour of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). These honors were in recognition of the city's outstanding achievements in the protection and improvement of the environment.
Las Piñas has recently acquired the status "Most Competitive City" in the Philippines, together with Davao City, Sekano (Makati), Muntinlupa and Marikina.


== Historiya ==
Las Piñas was one of the earliest fishing settlements on the shores of Manila Bay and was proclaimed a town either in 1762 or 1797. Its exact date of creation cannot be ascertained because historical records vary. Cavada, a Spanish historian and Fr. Juan Medina placed it at 1762, while Buzeta recorded the date at 1797.
Besides being famous for its Bamboo Organ, which was built by Fr. Diego Cera and completed in 1824, the town of Las Piñas was also a major war theater during the 1896 Philippine Revolution, as it was occupied by Gen. Emilio Aquinaldo's forces. Las Piñas was also, occupied by the Japanese during Second World War, to be followed by the liberation period, when the combined Filipino and American forces fought the Japanese Imperial armed forces until the end of war.
In 1901, the Municipality of Las Piñas was incorporated from Cavite to the newly created province of Rizal pursuant to Philippine Commission Act No. 137. Two years later, it was combined with Parañaque, the latter being the seat of a new municipal government.
It became a separate municipality from Parañaque on March 27, 1907 by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 1625. Then, with the founding of the Metropolitan Manila Area (Metro Manila in short) in 1976, Las Piñas became one of the municipalities making up the region.
On February 12, 1997, President Fidel Ramos signed the bill declaring Las Piñas a new city. A plebiscite held a month after found the residents in approval of cityhood and Las Piñas became the 10th city of Metro Manila on March 26, 1997.


== Gobiyerno ==
Las Piñas, like other cities of the Philippines, is a local government unit whose powers and functions are specified by the Local Government Code of the Philippines. In general, as a city, Las Piñas is headed by a mayor who heads the city's executive function and the vice mayor who heads the city's legislative function, which is composed of twelve councilors, six each from the city's two city council districts. For representation, the city is considered as one district, and therefore one representative, in the country's House of Representatives.
Additionally, like other cities and municipalities, Las Piñas is subdivided into barangays.

=== Ed walay pa ed saray Kastila ===
Mauswagong kabalayan na ang Sugbo mga tulo ka libo ka tuig kaniadto sa pa sakopa sa Espanya. Nakigbinayloay kini sa China ug uban pang kanasuran sa sidlakang-habagatang Asya.


=== Pag-abot so sakey Kastila ===
Miabot si Fernando de Magallanes sa Sugbo niadtong Abril 7, 1521. Gidawat sila isip mga dumuduong ni Radja Humabon nga kauban sa iyang asawa ug walo ka gatos nila ka sakop gipamunyagan sa mga Kachila niadtong Abril 14 isip mga unang Pilipinhong Katoliko. Apan pakyas hinuon si Magallano sa pag-ankon sa kapupud-ang Pilipinhon isip katigayonan sa hari sa Espanya sanglit napatay man siya ni Ka Lapulapu didto sa pulo sa Mactan pagka Abril 27 niadtong tuiga.
Abril 27, 1565, midunggo sa Sugbo si Miguel Lopez de Legazpi kuyog ang Agustinhong pareng si Andres de Urdaneta. Gisalid-an ni Legazpi ang ngalan sa dakbayan gikan sa San Miguel ngadto sa Villa del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus. Sulod sa unom ka tuig ang Sugbo maoy kaulohan sa bag-ong gitukod nga kolonya sa Espanya.
Gimugna ang lalawigan sa Sugbo ubos sa Act No. 2711 niadtong Marso 10, 1917. Mao kini ang natawhang lalawigan ni Sergio Osmeña, Sr. ang misunod pagkapangulo sa Commonwealth human ni Manuel L. Quezon panahon sa Ikaduhang Gubat sa Tibuok Kalibutan.
Ang lalawigan sa Sugbo ilabi na ang dakbayan sa Sugbo nakatagamtam og pagsaka sa international investments sa naunang bahin sa dekada 1990, diin namugna ang terminong CEBOOM isip tawag adtong pasakaha sa ekonomiya.
Giplanohang ipahigayon ang ASEAN Summit sa mga dakbayan sa Sugbu, Lapulapu, ug Mandaue niadtong 2006 apan tungod sa bagyong mihasi sa taliwalang Kapilipinhan gisibog ang maong panagtapok sa Enero 2007.


== Hiyograpiya ==
Ang Kan-irag Nature Park maoy parke sa baranggay sa Pung-ol Sibugay, sa mga bukiring parte sa dakbayan. Kini nag-abri tuig 2008, ug maoy parte usab sa Central Cebu Protected Landscape. Diri makit-an ang 100 ka eksotiko ug lumad nga espesye sa kahoy ug 27 ka espesye sa langgam.

Antes pa man mag-abot ang mga Katsilang kolonisador sa Pilipinas, usa na ka sentro sa komersyo sa kapupud-an ang Sugbo. Karon, kini ang sentrong pangkomersyo sa habagatan sa nasod, ug adunay duha ka distritong pampatigayon sa dakbayan: ang sukod sa Colon Street ug ang Cebu Business Park. Sa Lahug, makit-an usab ang Asiatown IT Park, usa ka deklaradong special economic zone.

== Relihiyon ==

Evangelized by the Agustinians between 1571 and 1580, Malolos formerly had its jurisdiction in Quingua—now Plaridel—from 1590–1602 and Paombong from 1580-1619. During this period,Malolos was an Encomienda until it was created as a civil town.The First Church was located in the Brgy Canalate near the river, but due to the frequent high tides that submerged the area, the friars moved the church to its present location in Poblacion in 1590. The majority of the residents are Christians. Roman Catholic is the predominant religion in the City.
Since the Spanish Period, Christianity, particularly Roman Catholicism faith in Malolos is very intensive. It is evident of the existence of the 3 big stone churches. Until now, Catholic faith in Malolos is still unwavering.
Being a dominant Catholic, Malolos together with the whole province of Bulacan is formerly annexed to the Archdiocese of Manila until March 11, 1962 when Pope John XXIII erected the Diocese of Malolos making the Malolos Church as its Cathedral.On March 2012 the Diocese of Malolos will celebrate its 50th Golden Jubilee with slogan "Biyaya at Pananampalataya" Fifty Years of Transforming Grace and Unwavering Faith.The Highlight of the celebration is the Canonical Coronation of the patroness and queen of the City and the whole Diocese,Virgen Inmaculada Concepcion de Malolos enshrined at the cathedral's altar.
Other religious groups include the Methodists, Aglipayans, Adventists, Baptists, Mormons, other Protestant churhes, and Nontrinitarian churches (like Members Church of God International, Iglesia ni Cristo, and Jehovah's Witness). There also some Evangelical, Pentecostal, Charismatic churhes, ministries, fellowships and religious groups. Islam (Muslims) could also be found in the city.

(c) Meskipun dijadikan sebahagian empayar Sepanyol, bahasa dan budaya Arab masih merupakan hasil kebudayaan yang dominan di Sahara Barat. Bahasa Sepanyol hanya ditutur oleh expatriat berbahasa Sepanyol dan orang berketurunan Sepanyol.
(d) Kebanyakan orang Gibraltar dapat bertutur dalam bahasa Inggeris dan Sepanyol kerana kedekatan wilayah British Gibraltar kepada negara Sepanyol. Meskipun kedua-dua bahasa ini paling banyak ditutur penduduk wilayah berkenaan (bersama-sama bahasa gabungannya Llanito), bahasa Inggeris masih merupakan satu-satunya bahasa rasmi di Gibraltar.

Say Ibaán sakey baley diad Pilipino ed luyag na Batangas
It is located 96 kilometre south of Manila. It is bounded on the north by and Lipa City; on the east by Marquez and Taysan; on the south by Batangas City; and on the west by Batangas City and San Jose, Philippines. It has a land area of 6,796 hectares at an altitude of 124 metres above sea level.
It is predominantly a Roman Catholic community, with minor percentage of Protestants and members of the Iglesia ni Cristo. Tagalog is the local dialect, however English is included in its educational curriculum and is often used in official dealings and transactions.
Temperature is moderate both in its rainy and dry seasons, conducive to farming, agricultural and livestock production which are the usual occupation of the people. There are less and less farmers each year because locals resort to hog raising which provides better income. Other sources of income are being engaged in business and profession. Ibaan is also known as the home of the "kulambo" (mosquito net) because the production and trading of such nets belong to one of the most profitable businesses in the locality.

(b) hanya melibatkan penduduk berumur 5 tahun atau lebih. Selain itu, sesiapa yang menutur bahasa ini sewaktu kerja atau dalam persekitaran lain tetapi bukan di rumah tidak termasuk di sini
(c) Meskipun dijadikan sebahagian empayar Sepanyol, bahasa dan budaya Arab masih merupakan hasil kebudayaan yang dominan di Sahara Barat. Bahasa Sepanyol hanya ditutur oleh expatriat berbahasa Sepanyol dan orang berketurunan Sepanyol.
(d) Kebanyakan orang Gibraltar dapat bertutur dalam bahasa Inggeris dan Sepanyol kerana kedekatan wilayah British Gibraltar kepada negara Sepanyol. Meskipun kedua-dua bahasa ini paling banyak ditutur penduduk wilayah berkenaan (bersama-sama bahasa gabungannya Llanito), bahasa Inggeris masih merupakan satu-satunya bahasa rasmi di Gibraltar.

== Relihiyon ==

Evangelized by the Agustinians between 1571 and 1580, Malolos formerly had its jurisdiction in Quingua—now Plaridel—from 1590–1602 and Paombong from 1580-1619. During this period,Malolos was an Encomienda until it was created as a civil town.The First Church was located in the Brgy Canalate near the river, but due to the frequent high tides that submerged the area, the friars moved the church to its present location in Poblacion in 1590. The majority of the residents are Christians. Roman Catholic is the predominant religion in the City.
Since the Spanish Period, Christianity, particularly Roman Catholicism faith in Malolos is very intensive. It is evident of the existence of the 3 big stone churches. Until now, Catholic faith in Malolos is still unwavering.
Being a dominant Catholic, Malolos together with the whole province of Bulacan is formerly annexed to the Archdiocese of Manila until March 11, 1962 when Pope John XXIII erected the Diocese of Malolos making the Malolos Church as its Cathedral.On March 2012 the Diocese of Malolos will celebrate its 50th Golden Jubilee with slogan "Biyaya at Pananampalataya" Fifty Years of Transforming Grace and Unwavering Faith.The Highlight of the celebration is the Canonical Coronation of the patroness and queen of the City and the whole Diocese,Virgen Inmaculada Concepcion de Malolos enshrined at the cathedral's altar.
Other religious groups include the Methodists, Aglipayans, Adventists, Baptists, Mormons, other Protestant churhes, and Nontrinitarian churches (like Members Church of God International, Iglesia ni Cristo, and Jehovah's Witness). There also some Evangelical, Pentecostal, Charismatic churhes, ministries, fellowships and religious groups. Islam (Muslims) could also be found in the city.

Europe is the world's second-smallest continent in terms of area, covering about 10 400 000 square kilometres (4,010,000 sq mi) or 2.0% of the Earth's surface. The only continent smaller than Europe is Australia. In terms of population, it is the third-largest continent (after Asia and Afrika) with a population of some 710,000,000, or about 11% of the world's population.
The European Union – comprising 25 member states, with two countries acceding in 2007 (Bulgaria and Romania) and two candidates in accession negotiations (Turkey and Croatia) – is the largest political and economic entity covering the European continent, while Russia (excluding portions in Asia) is the second largest entity and Europe's largest state in area and population.

(b) hanya melibatkan penduduk berumur 5 tahun atau lebih. Selain itu, sesiapa yang menutur bahasa ini sewaktu kerja atau dalam persekitaran lain tetapi bukan di rumah tidak termasuk di sini
(c) Meskipun dijadikan sebahagian empayar Sepanyol, bahasa dan budaya Arab masih merupakan hasil kebudayaan yang dominan di Sahara Barat. Bahasa Sepanyol hanya ditutur oleh expatriat berbahasa Sepanyol dan orang berketurunan Sepanyol.
(d) Kebanyakan orang Gibraltar dapat bertutur dalam bahasa Inggeris dan Sepanyol kerana kedekatan wilayah British Gibraltar kepada negara Sepanyol. Meskipun kedua-dua bahasa ini paling banyak ditutur penduduk wilayah berkenaan (bersama-sama bahasa gabungannya Llanito), bahasa Inggeris masih merupakan satu-satunya bahasa rasmi di Gibraltar.

Say Las Piñas sakey siyudad diad Pilipino ed Metro Manila.


== Say siyudad ==
Since its establishment as a small fishing port and a major salt-making center during the Spanish Era, Las Piñas has grown into an important residential, commercial and industrial suburb of Metro Manila.
Las Piñas is famous for its Bamboo Organ, located inside the St. Joseph Church of the Parish of Las Piñas, formerly known as San Jose Parish Church in the Spanish Period, as the only organ of its kind in the world. Built in 1824 by Catholic priest, Fr. Diego Cera, created out of bamboo, wood, and metal, this famous organ is praised for its unique, rare, and melodious sound.
The Sarao Motors factory is also located in Las Piñas, the place where Jeepneys are assembled piece by piece in painstaking individual production. The factory remains open to buyers and curious visitors all year round.
Las Piñas has a large shopping mall named SM Southmall, which has an area of 205,120 square meters and is located along Alabang–Zapote Road. The newest shopping mall development in the city is SM Center Las Piñas, located few meters away from the City Hall. The first high rise building in the city is 16 story residential building Almanza Metropolis.
Las Piñas, also known as one of the cleanest cities in Metro Manila, is in the list of the "Clean and Green Hall of Fame" awarded by the Philippine Government. It is also the first local government unit in the Philippines that has been honored with the prestigious Global 500 Roll of Honour of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). These honors were in recognition of the city's outstanding achievements in the protection and improvement of the environment.
Las Piñas has recently acquired the status "Most Competitive City" in the Philippines, together with Davao City, Sekano (Makati), Muntinlupa and Marikina.


== Historiya ==
Las Piñas was one of the earliest fishing settlements on the shores of Manila Bay and was proclaimed a town either in 1762 or 1797. Its exact date of creation cannot be ascertained because historical records vary. Cavada, a Spanish historian and Fr. Juan Medina placed it at 1762, while Buzeta recorded the date at 1797.
Besides being famous for its Bamboo Organ, which was built by Fr. Diego Cera and completed in 1824, the town of Las Piñas was also a major war theater during the 1896 Philippine Revolution, as it was occupied by Gen. Emilio Aquinaldo's forces. Las Piñas was also, occupied by the Japanese during Second World War, to be followed by the liberation period, when the combined Filipino and American forces fought the Japanese Imperial armed forces until the end of war.
In 1901, the Municipality of Las Piñas was incorporated from Cavite to the newly created province of Rizal pursuant to Philippine Commission Act No. 137. Two years later, it was combined with Parañaque, the latter being the seat of a new municipal government.
It became a separate municipality from Parañaque on March 27, 1907 by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 1625. Then, with the founding of the Metropolitan Manila Area (Metro Manila in short) in 1976, Las Piñas became one of the municipalities making up the region.
On February 12, 1997, President Fidel Ramos signed the bill declaring Las Piñas a new city. A plebiscite held a month after found the residents in approval of cityhood and Las Piñas became the 10th city of Metro Manila on March 26, 1997.


== Gobiyerno ==
Las Piñas, like other cities of the Philippines, is a local government unit whose powers and functions are specified by the Local Government Code of the Philippines. In general, as a city, Las Piñas is headed by a mayor who heads the city's executive function and the vice mayor who heads the city's legislative function, which is composed of twelve councilors, six each from the city's two city council districts. For representation, the city is considered as one district, and therefore one representative, in the country's House of Representatives.
Additionally, like other cities and municipalities, Las Piñas is subdivided into barangays.

== Hiyograpiko ==
Trece Martires City is strategically located in the heart of the Province of Cavite. It is bounded by Tanza town to the north and west, Naic also to the west, Amadeo and Indang to the south, and General Trias to the east. It is located about Template:Convert from Manila, the capital of the Philippines, or about an hour by car.


== Historiya ==
Trece Martires started as one of the largest and remotest barrios in Cavite. It was originally named Quinta or Quintana and was part of the municipality of Tanza, Cavite. The land was basically agricultural subdivided into cattle ranches and sugar farms, with less than one thousand hectares, located at the intersection of the Tanza-Indang Road and the present Naic-Dasmariñas Road in the province.
The city was established on May 24, 1954 under Republic Act No. 981 entitled "The Charter of Trece Martires City" as approved by President Ramón Magsaysay. The Republic Act also transferred the capital of the province from Cavite City to Trece Martires. The original bill, House Bill 1795, was authored by Congressman Jose T. Cajulis (1954–1957) and Senator Justiniano S. Montano (1949–1956).
Under the city charter, the Governor of the province is the ex-officio city mayor of Trece Martires City thus making then Governor Dominador Mangubat as the city's first chief executive. On January 2, 1956, the provincial capitol was formally inaugurated, the same day the newly-elected governor, Delfin N. Montano, the son of Senator Justiniano Montano, was sworn into office. He served as governor and mayor of Trece Martires from 1956 to 1971.
On June 22, 1957 the original act was amended by Republic Act 1912 increasing its territory to 3917 hectares, more or less. Consequently, the municipalities of Indang and General Trias had to yield parts of their respective areas to this territorial expansion.
Former President Ferdinand Marcos signed Presidential Decree No. 1163 relocating the capital and seat of government from Trece Martires to Imus City. Governor Juanito Victor C. Remulla requested Marcos in September 1979 to transfer the capital back to Trece Martires City. As of 2012, the provincial capital is still Imus City, but most of the provincial offices are still located in Trece Martires City.
On March 31, 1992, the Republic Act no. 7325 was approved by President Corazon Aquino amending the charter of Trece Martires City, allowing the city to vote their own local officials for the first time.

Say Quezon sakey 4th class ya baley ed luyag na Isabela, Filipinas. Onong ed 2000 census, walay population to ya 20,090 ya too diad 3,887 ya pamilya.


== Historiya ==
Unlike some parts of Isabela like Santiago City, Echague and Alicia the history of the municipality of Quezon is relatively recent. The former municipalities have long been seats of rich and colorful historical events that influenced the lives of the people of Isabela since its creation on May 1, 1856 through a Royal Decree issued in honor of Queen Isabella II of Spain (reigned 1843 to 1868). It was in these very places where decisions that ultimately governed the lives of the local people were made by Spanish authorities.
Prior to its creation, Quezon was once part of a vast track of agricultural land called the Mallig Plains. At that time, the area that is presently under the political jurisdiction of the municipality was sparsely populated. Historians believe that the precursor of the present inhabitants of Quezon were the Igorots and the Kalingas of the Cordilleras. Although the Igorots and the Kalingas are primarily upland dwellers, historians have observed that these natives come down from the highlands from time to time to hunt for low-landers especially the Kanyaw rituals.
When Manuel L. Quezon was elected as the President of the Philippine Commonwealth, one of his administration’s main programs was to promote development in the other areas in the country aside from Manila. In order to achieve this objective, President Quezon opened up vast uninhabited areas for settlement hoping that these would be developed by those who will decide to settle in those areas. Aside from Mindanao, other parts of Luzon were similarly offered for settlement and development including the province of Isabela, particularly the northwestern portion of the province which was later called Mallig Plains.
Citing for the potential of the area for settlement and agricultural development, President Quezon declared the entire land area of Mallig Plains as project site for his program on rural development. In support of this declaration, he created the Office of National Land Settlement Administration which was renamed to Land Settlement Development Corporation (LaSeDeCo). Subsequently, this corporation was reorganized. At that time, the primary objective of LaSeDeCo was basically to oversee and facilitate the distribution of lands to qualified settlers. With the development of this opportunity for rural and agricultural development and with the completion of the BaleteTemplate:Disambiguation needed Pass Road in the 1920s that runs through the hinterlands of the Caraballo Mountains, hundreds of inhabitants from the Ilocos and Central Luzon regions opted to settle and avail of the program of the government in the Mallig Plains area.
A few years after the declaration of the area as site for settlement and agricultural development, World War II broke out and the region was later placed under Japanese control, Although the extent of damage on properties and the number of lives lost during the war was nothing compared to other areas in the Philippines, early settlers of the region had difficulty rebuilding their lives after the war for they were not spared from the wrath inflicted by the members of the Kalinga tribes from the north.
One of those who fiercely and bravely fought the onslaught of the Kalinga was Jesus Estrada for whom a barangay was named after him. It was only after the government and leaders of the tribes negotiated and agreed to end hostilities that the threat to the lives of early settlers of the region was eventually dispelled.
With the attainment of peace and security in the area, the exodus of settlers to the area increased particularly in the area of Barrio Narra where the future site of Quezon is located. But the continued influx of new settlers into the area increased the demand for basic requirements of the local residents. Officials of Isabela, particularly Representative Delfin Albano of the lone district of Isabela saw the urgency and the need to create a new municipality out of Mallig. House Bill No. 736 authored by Albano was later approved by the Philippine Senate and President Carlos P. Garcia in 1959 through Republic Act No. 2418. The name of the municipality was in honor of the last President Manuel L. Quezon who was instrumental in the development of the municipalities of Mallig and Quezon.
Hildebrando Pecson was appointed as the first mayor of the newly created municipality from 1960 until 1967 when after his term limit allowed by law then, he was succeeded by Hermogenes Padilla in the 1967 local elections. In 1971 local elections, Gavino Gascon challenged Padilla and was popularly elected by people. In 1976, he was replaced by William Corpuz and was in turn unseated in 1978. Oniate Tabangcura, a former officer of the military replaced Corpuz. When President Ferdinand Marcos was overthrown on 1986 through the 1986 EDSA Revolution, President Corazon Aquino issued and executive order replacing all local executives all throughout the Philippines. Corpuz was appointed as Officer-In-Charge Mayor of Quezon. On 1988 local elections, Gavino Gascon had his seat back,again with popular votes, as mayor of Quezon. He was reelected in the 1992 and 1995 local elections. Due to term limit as stated on the 1987 Philippine Constitution and the Local Government Code of 1991, the position of mayor was left as an open race in the 1998 elections. Lawyer Eduardo Cabantac won as municipal mayor. He was reelected in 2001 local elections Cabantac was again reelected in the 2004 local elections leaving the 2007 local elections as an open race again. Gascon's son Daryl won as mayor in the said election.

Say Urdaneta City (salitan Pangasinan: Siyudad na Urdaneta) siyudad ed luyag na Pangasinan, Filipinas. Onong ed 2000 census, walay population to ya 111,582 ya too diad 22,908 ya pamilya. The city has been identified by the Province of Pangasinan as a growth pole, thereby making the sorrounding localities as its satellite.


== Geography ==
The City of Urdaneta is located in eastern part of the Province of Pangasinan, situated on 15°56' to 16°0' latitude and 120°29' to 120°37' longitude.
Traverse by the Manila North Road virtually bisecting the locality into the west and east side. The city is bounded north by the Municipalities of Binalonan, Laoac and Manaoag, south by villasis, east by Asingan and west by Sta. Barbara and Malasiqui.
The city is approximately 186 km. from Metro Manila, 70 km. from Baguio, and 40 km. from Lingayen.


== Historical Background ==
Other localities have legends of their own as to how their names evolved. Urdaneta differs.
The Purists maintain that since the Spanish root word was organo, the correct name should have been "Organists". On the other hand, the Theorists are of the opinion that the original name of the city was "Organeta" meaning "little organ or unit" considering that at that time, the place was composed of portions of barrios of adjacent towns where travelers and traders converged.
But the next issue that biweldered the concerned groups was whether the city was named after Fr. Andres Urdaneta or Fr. Simon de Urdaneta. While the archives of the National Library show that it was after Fr. Miguel de Urdaneta, some articles on the city's history envariably reffered to Fr. Simon de Urdaneta. Curiously noted historian Fr. Jose Ma. Gonzalez, author of "Labor Evangelica y Civilizadora delos Religioso en Pangasinan", was silent in this issue.


== Creation of the City ==
On January 10, 1998, the Philippine Congress enacted and passed R.A. 8480 converting the Municipality of Urdaneta as a component city of the Province of Pangasinan. The electorate in a plebiscite overhelmingly ratified this legislative act and the locality was proclaimed as a city on March 21, 1998.


== Establishments ==
Most commercial establishments in Urdaneta such as large department and variety stores, business and professional offices, hotels and theaters are found in brgy's Poblacion, Nancayasan and San Vicente. There are also food chains such as Jollibee, McDonald's, Cindys, Shakeys, Chowking and KFC. And offices of multinational companies, among which are those of Coca-Cola Phils., Pepsi-Cola, San Miguel Corp. and Nestle products. There are also malls in the city such as Magic Mall and CB Balingit Mall. SM Prime Holdings also wants also to put up a mall in the city. The city also hosts the Sanctuary I.T. Building Pangasinan's first Philippine Ecozone Authroity (PEZA) building in Barangay Nancayasan.


== Education ==
Urdaneta city has more elementary schools and more high schools than any other cities and towns in Pangasinan.The city is a center of education in Eastern Pangasinan due to numerous tertiary institution, including:
Toplite Polytechnic Colleges, Inc.
Lyceum Northwestern University
Lyceum Northern Luzon
Urdaneta City University (UCU)
PanPacific University North Philippines (PUNP)
Urdaneta College of Technology
Divine Word College of Urdaneta
Pangasinan State University
STI-Urdaneta
AMA-Urdaneta
ABE-International College of Business and Economics
Luzon Colleges of Science and Technology


== Notable Persons ==
Dr. Pedro T. Orata - ORATA was born in Bangar, a remote sitio (section) of Barrio (village) Bactad, Urdaneta, in northern Pangasinan Province of the Philippines, on February 27, 1899. He was a Magsaysay Awardee and dubbed as the Father of barangay High Schools.
Danny Ildefonso - PBA player and two time MVP.


== Urdaneta tops in finances ==
Urdaneta City is now the cream of the crop. Based on the financial report released by the Commission on Audit for 2005, Urdaneta City is now the leading city not only in Pangasinan but in the Northwestern Luzon region in terms of net income, gross income, total assets and total equity. The COA report showed Urdaneta reported a net income of P132,107,000 with a gross income of P382,699,000 and expenses amounting to P250,582,000, considered only as the third highest among eight cities in the region. Urdaneta, which won its cityhood only in March 1998, had the highest total assets among all the region’s cities totaling P810,722,000, registering total equity of P693,166,000 with total liabilities of P117,546,000, among the lowest in the region so far.
In contrast, Dagupan City the oldest city in Region 1 had the lowest net income among in the province and among eight Northwestern Luzon Region cities at P18,901,000, according to the COA financial report. Dagupan, however, registered the second highest total income at P357,404,000 but the report showed it is also the biggest spender among all eight cities, registering total expenditure amounting to P338,503,000 in 2005.
Urdaneta and Dagupan City are the only second class cities in the Northwestern Luzon region today. But Urdaneta’s rise to second class from fourth class when it earned its city hood eight years ago is considered phenomenal.
Dagupan trails Urdaneta in total assets at P713,760,000 but again it registered the highest total liabilities among all cities in the region at P372,420,000, placing its total equity to P341,340,000.

The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest ocean, covering approximately one-fifth of the Earth's surface. The ocean's name, derived from Greek mythology, means the "Sea of Atlas." The oldest known mention of this name is contained in The Histories of Herodotus around 450 BC (I 202).
This ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending in a north-south direction and is divided into the North Atlantic and South Atlantic by Equatorial Counter Currents at about 8° North latitude. Bounded by the Americas on the west and Europe and Africa on the east, the Atlantic is linked to the Pacific Ocean by the Arctic Ocean on the north and the Drake Passage on the south. A man-made connection between the Atlantic and Pacific is provided by the Panama Canal. On the east, the dividing line between the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean is the 20° East meridian, running south from Cape Agulhas to Antarctica. The Atlantic is separated from the Arctic by a line from Greenland to northwestern Iceland and then from northeastern Iceland to the southernmost tip of Spitsbergen and then to North Cape in northern Norway.
Covering approximately 20% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic Ocean is second only to the Pacific in size. With its adjacent seas it occupies an area of about 106,400,000 square kilometres (41,100,000 sq mi); without them, it has an area of 82,400,000 square kilometres (31,800,000 sq mi). The land area that drains into the Atlantic is four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans. The volume of the Atlantic Ocean with its adjacent seas is 354,700,000 cubic kilometres (85,100,000 cu mi) and without them 323,600,000 cubic kilometres (77,640,000 cu mi).
The average depths of the Atlantic, with its adjacent seas, is 3,338 metres (10,932 ft); without them it is 3,926 metres (12,881 ft). The greatest depth, 8,605 metres (28,232 ft), is in the Puerto Rico Trench. The width of the Atlantic varies from 2,848 kilometres (1,770 mi) between Brazil and Liberia to about 4,830 kilometres (3,000 mi) between the United States and northern Africa.


== Water characteristics ==

On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest of the world's major oceans; the salinity of the surface waters in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand by mass and varies with latitude and season. Surface salinity values are influenced by evaporation, precipitation, river inflow, and melting of sea ice. Although the minimum salinity values are found just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers flow into the ocean. Maximum salinity values occur at about 25° north and south of the equator, in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.
Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from less than −2 °Celsius to 29 °C (28 °F to 84 °F). Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7 °C to 8 °C (44 °F to 46 °F).
The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses. The North and South Atlantic central waters constitute the surface waters. The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). The North Atlantic deep water reaches depths of as much as 4,000 metres (13,200 ft). The Antarctic bottom water occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 metres (13,200 ft).
Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate a large elongated body of water known as the Sargasso Sea, in which the salinity is noticeably higher than average. The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of seaweed and is also the spawning ground for the European eel.
Because of the Coriolis effect, water in the North Atlantic circulates in a clockwise direction, whereas water circulation in the South Atlantic is counter-clockwise. The south tides in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. The tides are a general wave that moves from south to north. In latitudes above 40° North some east-west oscillation occurs.


== Climate ==

The climate of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent land areas is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as the winds blowing across the waters. Because of the ocean's great capacity for retaining heat, maritime climates are moderate and free of extreme seasonal variations. Precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from the water temperatures. The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest climatic zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in the high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents contribute to climatic control by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. Adjacent land areas are affected by the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents. The Gulf Stream, for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and northwestern Europe, and the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of northeastern Canada (the Grand Banks area) and the northwestern coast of Africa. In general, winds tend to transport moisture and warm or cool air over land areas. Hurricanes develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean.


== History ==
The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of the world's oceans, after the Southern Ocean. Evidence indicates that it did not exist prior to 180 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral supercontinent, Pangaea, were being rafted apart by the process of seafloor spreading. The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements were established along its shores. The Vikings, Portuguese, and Christopher Columbus were the most famous among its early explorers. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established. As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the Americas (known as transatlantic trade). Numerous scientific explorations have been undertaken, including those by the German Meteor expedition, Columbia University's Lamont Geological Observatory, and the United States Navy Hydrographic Office.
Some important events in relation to the Atlantic:
In 1858, the first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid by Cyrus Field.
On April 14th 1912 the RMS Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg with loss of 1,593 people.
In 1919, the American NC-4 became the first airplane to cross the Atlantic (though it made a couple of landings on islands along the way).
Later in 1919, a British airplane piloted by Alcock and Brown made the first non-stop transatlantic flight, from Newfoundland to Ireland.
In 1921, the British were the first to cross the North Atlantic in an airship.
In 1922, the Portuguese were the first to cross the South Atlantic in an airship.
The first transatlantic telephone call was made on January 7, 1927.
In 1927, Charles Lindbergh made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an airplane (between New York City and Paris).
In 1998, Ben Lecomte was the first person to swim across the Atlantic Ocean, stopping for only one week in the Azores.
After rowing for 81 days and 4,767 kilometres (2,962 mi), on December 3, 1999, Tori Murden became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by rowboat alone when she reached Guadeloupe from the Canary Islands.


== Economy ==
The ocean has also contributed significantly to the development and economy of the countries around it. Besides its major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves and the world's richest fishing resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major species of fish caught are cod, haddock, hake, herring, and mackerel. The most productive areas include the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, the shelf area off Nova Scotia, Georges Bank off Cape Cod, the Bahama Banks, the waters around Iceland, the Irish Sea, the Dogger Bank of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks. Eel, lobster, and whales have also been taken in great quantities. All these factors, taken together, tremendously enhance the Atlantic's great commercial value. Because of the threats to the ocean environment presented by oil spills, marine debris, and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea, various international treaties exist to reduce some forms of pollution.


== Current environmental issues ==
Endangered marine species include the manatee, seals, sea lions, turtles, and whales. Drift net fishing is killing dolphins, albatrosses and other seabirds (petrels, auks), hastening the decline of fish stocks and contributing to international disputes. There is municipal sludge pollution off the eastern United States, southern Brazil, and eastern Argentina; oil pollution in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Lake Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.
On June 7, 2006, Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off of the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.

There is municipal sludge pollution off the eastern United States, southern Brazil, and eastern Argentina; oil pollution in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Lake Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.
On June 7, 2006, Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off of the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.

The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest ocean, covering approximately one-fifth of the Earth's surface. The ocean's name, derived from Greek mythology, means the "Sea of Atlas." The oldest known mention of this name is contained in The Histories of Herodotus around 450 BC (I 202).
This ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending in a north-south direction and is divided into the North Atlantic and South Atlantic by Equatorial Counter Currents at about 8° North latitude. Bounded by the Americas on the west and Europe and Africa on the east, the Atlantic is linked to the Pacific Ocean by the Arctic Ocean on the north and the Drake Passage on the south. A man-made connection between the Atlantic and Pacific is provided by the Panama Canal. On the east, the dividing line between the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean is the 20° East meridian, running south from Cape Agulhas to Antarctica. The Atlantic is separated from the Arctic by a line from Greenland to northwestern Iceland and then from northeastern Iceland to the southernmost tip of Spitsbergen and then to North Cape in northern Norway.
Covering approximately 20% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic Ocean is second only to the Pacific in size. With its adjacent seas it occupies an area of about 106,400,000 square kilometres (41,100,000 sq mi); without them, it has an area of 82,400,000 square kilometres (31,800,000 sq mi). The land area that drains into the Atlantic is four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans. The volume of the Atlantic Ocean with its adjacent seas is 354,700,000 cubic kilometres (85,100,000 cu mi) and without them 323,600,000 cubic kilometres (77,640,000 cu mi).
The average depths of the Atlantic, with its adjacent seas, is 3,338 metres (10,932 ft); without them it is 3,926 metres (12,881 ft). The greatest depth, 8,605 metres (28,232 ft), is in the Puerto Rico Trench. The width of the Atlantic varies from 2,848 kilometres (1,770 mi) between Brazil and Liberia to about 4,830 kilometres (3,000 mi) between the United States and northern Africa.


== Water characteristics ==

On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest of the world's major oceans; the salinity of the surface waters in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand by mass and varies with latitude and season. Surface salinity values are influenced by evaporation, precipitation, river inflow, and melting of sea ice. Although the minimum salinity values are found just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers flow into the ocean. Maximum salinity values occur at about 25° north and south of the equator, in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.
Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from less than −2 °Celsius to 29 °C (28 °F to 84 °F). Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7 °C to 8 °C (44 °F to 46 °F).
The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses. The North and South Atlantic central waters constitute the surface waters. The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). The North Atlantic deep water reaches depths of as much as 4,000 metres (13,200 ft). The Antarctic bottom water occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 metres (13,200 ft).
Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate a large elongated body of water known as the Sargasso Sea, in which the salinity is noticeably higher than average. The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of seaweed and is also the spawning ground for the European eel.
Because of the Coriolis effect, water in the North Atlantic circulates in a clockwise direction, whereas water circulation in the South Atlantic is counter-clockwise. The south tides in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. The tides are a general wave that moves from south to north. In latitudes above 40° North some east-west oscillation occurs.


== Climate ==

The climate of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent land areas is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as the winds blowing across the waters. Because of the ocean's great capacity for retaining heat, maritime climates are moderate and free of extreme seasonal variations. Precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from the water temperatures. The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest climatic zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in the high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents contribute to climatic control by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. Adjacent land areas are affected by the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents. The Gulf Stream, for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and northwestern Europe, and the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of northeastern Canada (the Grand Banks area) and the northwestern coast of Africa. In general, winds tend to transport moisture and warm or cool air over land areas. Hurricanes develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean.


== History ==
The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of the world's oceans, after the Southern Ocean. Evidence indicates that it did not exist prior to 180 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral supercontinent, Pangaea, were being rafted apart by the process of seafloor spreading. The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements were established along its shores. The Vikings, Portuguese, and Christopher Columbus were the most famous among its early explorers. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established. As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the Americas (known as transatlantic trade). Numerous scientific explorations have been undertaken, including those by the German Meteor expedition, Columbia University's Lamont Geological Observatory, and the United States Navy Hydrographic Office.
Some important events in relation to the Atlantic:
In 1858, the first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid by Cyrus Field.
On April 14th 1912 the RMS Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg with loss of 1,593 people.
In 1919, the American NC-4 became the first airplane to cross the Atlantic (though it made a couple of landings on islands along the way).
Later in 1919, a British airplane piloted by Alcock and Brown made the first non-stop transatlantic flight, from Newfoundland to Ireland.
In 1921, the British were the first to cross the North Atlantic in an airship.
In 1922, the Portuguese were the first to cross the South Atlantic in an airship.
The first transatlantic telephone call was made on January 7, 1927.
In 1927, Charles Lindbergh made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an airplane (between New York City and Paris).
In 1998, Ben Lecomte was the first person to swim across the Atlantic Ocean, stopping for only one week in the Azores.
After rowing for 81 days and 4,767 kilometres (2,962 mi), on December 3, 1999, Tori Murden became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by rowboat alone when she reached Guadeloupe from the Canary Islands.


== Economy ==
The ocean has also contributed significantly to the development and economy of the countries around it. Besides its major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves and the world's richest fishing resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major species of fish caught are cod, haddock, hake, herring, and mackerel. The most productive areas include the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, the shelf area off Nova Scotia, Georges Bank off Cape Cod, the Bahama Banks, the waters around Iceland, the Irish Sea, the Dogger Bank of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks. Eel, lobster, and whales have also been taken in great quantities. All these factors, taken together, tremendously enhance the Atlantic's great commercial value. Because of the threats to the ocean environment presented by oil spills, marine debris, and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea, various international treaties exist to reduce some forms of pollution.


== Current environmental issues ==
Endangered marine species include the manatee, seals, sea lions, turtles, and whales. Drift net fishing is killing dolphins, albatrosses and other seabirds (petrels, auks), hastening the decline of fish stocks and contributing to international disputes. There is municipal sludge pollution off the eastern United States, southern Brazil, and eastern Argentina; oil pollution in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Lake Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.
On June 7, 2006, Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off of the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.

The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest ocean, covering approximately one-fifth of the Earth's surface. The ocean's name, derived from Greek mythology, means the "Sea of Atlas." The oldest known mention of this name is contained in The Histories of Herodotus around 450 BC (I 202).
This ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending in a north-south direction and is divided into the North Atlantic and South Atlantic by Equatorial Counter Currents at about 8° North latitude. Bounded by the Americas on the west and Europe and Africa on the east, the Atlantic is linked to the Pacific Ocean by the Arctic Ocean on the north and the Drake Passage on the south. A man-made connection between the Atlantic and Pacific is provided by the Panama Canal. On the east, the dividing line between the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean is the 20° East meridian, running south from Cape Agulhas to Antarctica. The Atlantic is separated from the Arctic by a line from Greenland to northwestern Iceland and then from northeastern Iceland to the southernmost tip of Spitsbergen and then to North Cape in northern Norway.
Covering approximately 20% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic Ocean is second only to the Pacific in size. With its adjacent seas it occupies an area of about 106,400,000 square kilometres (41,100,000 sq mi); without them, it has an area of 82,400,000 square kilometres (31,800,000 sq mi). The land area that drains into the Atlantic is four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans. The volume of the Atlantic Ocean with its adjacent seas is 354,700,000 cubic kilometres (85,100,000 cu mi) and without them 323,600,000 cubic kilometres (77,640,000 cu mi).
The average depths of the Atlantic, with its adjacent seas, is 3,338 metres (10,932 ft); without them it is 3,926 metres (12,881 ft). The greatest depth, 8,605 metres (28,232 ft), is in the Puerto Rico Trench. The width of the Atlantic varies from 2,848 kilometres (1,770 mi) between Brazil and Liberia to about 4,830 kilometres (3,000 mi) between the United States and northern Africa.


== Water characteristics ==

On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest of the world's major oceans; the salinity of the surface waters in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand by mass and varies with latitude and season. Surface salinity values are influenced by evaporation, precipitation, river inflow, and melting of sea ice. Although the minimum salinity values are found just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers flow into the ocean. Maximum salinity values occur at about 25° north and south of the equator, in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.
Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from less than −2 °Celsius to 29 °C (28 °F to 84 °F). Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7 °C to 8 °C (44 °F to 46 °F).
The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses. The North and South Atlantic central waters constitute the surface waters. The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). The North Atlantic deep water reaches depths of as much as 4,000 metres (13,200 ft). The Antarctic bottom water occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 metres (13,200 ft).
Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate a large elongated body of water known as the Sargasso Sea, in which the salinity is noticeably higher than average. The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of seaweed and is also the spawning ground for the European eel.
Because of the Coriolis effect, water in the North Atlantic circulates in a clockwise direction, whereas water circulation in the South Atlantic is counter-clockwise. The south tides in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. The tides are a general wave that moves from south to north. In latitudes above 40° North some east-west oscillation occurs.


== Climate ==

The climate of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent land areas is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as the winds blowing across the waters. Because of the ocean's great capacity for retaining heat, maritime climates are moderate and free of extreme seasonal variations. Precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from the water temperatures. The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest climatic zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in the high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents contribute to climatic control by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. Adjacent land areas are affected by the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents. The Gulf Stream, for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and northwestern Europe, and the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of northeastern Canada (the Grand Banks area) and the northwestern coast of Africa. In general, winds tend to transport moisture and warm or cool air over land areas. Hurricanes develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean.


== History ==
The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of the world's oceans, after the Southern Ocean. Evidence indicates that it did not exist prior to 180 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral supercontinent, Pangaea, were being rafted apart by the process of seafloor spreading. The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements were established along its shores. The Vikings, Portuguese, and Christopher Columbus were the most famous among its early explorers. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established. As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the Americas (known as transatlantic trade). Numerous scientific explorations have been undertaken, including those by the German Meteor expedition, Columbia University's Lamont Geological Observatory, and the United States Navy Hydrographic Office.
Some important events in relation to the Atlantic:
In 1858, the first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid by Cyrus Field.
On April 14th 1912 the RMS Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg with loss of 1,593 people.
In 1919, the American NC-4 became the first airplane to cross the Atlantic (though it made a couple of landings on islands along the way).
Later in 1919, a British airplane piloted by Alcock and Brown made the first non-stop transatlantic flight, from Newfoundland to Ireland.
In 1921, the British were the first to cross the North Atlantic in an airship.
In 1922, the Portuguese were the first to cross the South Atlantic in an airship.
The first transatlantic telephone call was made on January 7, 1927.
In 1927, Charles Lindbergh made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an airplane (between New York City and Paris).
In 1998, Ben Lecomte was the first person to swim across the Atlantic Ocean, stopping for only one week in the Azores.
After rowing for 81 days and 4,767 kilometres (2,962 mi), on December 3, 1999, Tori Murden became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by rowboat alone when she reached Guadeloupe from the Canary Islands.


== Economy ==
The ocean has also contributed significantly to the development and economy of the countries around it. Besides its major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves and the world's richest fishing resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major species of fish caught are cod, haddock, hake, herring, and mackerel. The most productive areas include the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, the shelf area off Nova Scotia, Georges Bank off Cape Cod, the Bahama Banks, the waters around Iceland, the Irish Sea, the Dogger Bank of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks. Eel, lobster, and whales have also been taken in great quantities. All these factors, taken together, tremendously enhance the Atlantic's great commercial value. Because of the threats to the ocean environment presented by oil spills, marine debris, and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea, various international treaties exist to reduce some forms of pollution.


== Current environmental issues ==
Endangered marine species include the manatee, seals, sea lions, turtles, and whales. Drift net fishing is killing dolphins, albatrosses and other seabirds (petrels, auks), hastening the decline of fish stocks and contributing to international disputes. There is municipal sludge pollution off the eastern United States, southern Brazil, and eastern Argentina; oil pollution in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Lake Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.
On June 7, 2006, Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off of the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.

Europe is the world's second-smallest continent in terms of area, covering about 10 400 000 square kilometres (4,010,000 sq mi) or 2.0% of the Earth's surface. The only continent smaller than Europe is Australia. In terms of population, it is the third-largest continent (after Asia and Afrika) with a population of some 710,000,000, or about 11% of the world's population.
The European Union – comprising 25 member states, with two countries acceding in 2007 (Bulgaria and Romania) and two candidates in accession negotiations (Turkey and Croatia) – is the largest political and economic entity covering the European continent, while Russia (excluding portions in Asia) is the second largest entity and Europe's largest state in area and population.

The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest ocean, covering approximately one-fifth of the Earth's surface. The ocean's name, derived from Greek mythology, means the "Sea of Atlas." The oldest known mention of this name is contained in The Histories of Herodotus around 450 BC (I 202).
This ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending in a north-south direction and is divided into the North Atlantic and South Atlantic by Equatorial Counter Currents at about 8° North latitude. Bounded by the Americas on the west and Europe and Africa on the east, the Atlantic is linked to the Pacific Ocean by the Arctic Ocean on the north and the Drake Passage on the south. A man-made connection between the Atlantic and Pacific is provided by the Panama Canal. On the east, the dividing line between the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean is the 20° East meridian, running south from Cape Agulhas to Antarctica. The Atlantic is separated from the Arctic by a line from Greenland to northwestern Iceland and then from northeastern Iceland to the southernmost tip of Spitsbergen and then to North Cape in northern Norway.
Covering approximately 20% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic Ocean is second only to the Pacific in size. With its adjacent seas it occupies an area of about 106,400,000 square kilometres (41,100,000 sq mi); without them, it has an area of 82,400,000 square kilometres (31,800,000 sq mi). The land area that drains into the Atlantic is four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans. The volume of the Atlantic Ocean with its adjacent seas is 354,700,000 cubic kilometres (85,100,000 cu mi) and without them 323,600,000 cubic kilometres (77,640,000 cu mi).
The average depths of the Atlantic, with its adjacent seas, is 3,338 metres (10,932 ft); without them it is 3,926 metres (12,881 ft). The greatest depth, 8,605 metres (28,232 ft), is in the Puerto Rico Trench. The width of the Atlantic varies from 2,848 kilometres (1,770 mi) between Brazil and Liberia to about 4,830 kilometres (3,000 mi) between the United States and northern Africa.


== Water characteristics ==

On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest of the world's major oceans; the salinity of the surface waters in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand by mass and varies with latitude and season. Surface salinity values are influenced by evaporation, precipitation, river inflow, and melting of sea ice. Although the minimum salinity values are found just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers flow into the ocean. Maximum salinity values occur at about 25° north and south of the equator, in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.
Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from less than −2 °Celsius to 29 °C (28 °F to 84 °F). Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7 °C to 8 °C (44 °F to 46 °F).
The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses. The North and South Atlantic central waters constitute the surface waters. The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). The North Atlantic deep water reaches depths of as much as 4,000 metres (13,200 ft). The Antarctic bottom water occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 metres (13,200 ft).
Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate a large elongated body of water known as the Sargasso Sea, in which the salinity is noticeably higher than average. The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of seaweed and is also the spawning ground for the European eel.
Because of the Coriolis effect, water in the North Atlantic circulates in a clockwise direction, whereas water circulation in the South Atlantic is counter-clockwise. The south tides in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. The tides are a general wave that moves from south to north. In latitudes above 40° North some east-west oscillation occurs.


== Climate ==

The climate of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent land areas is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as the winds blowing across the waters. Because of the ocean's great capacity for retaining heat, maritime climates are moderate and free of extreme seasonal variations. Precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from the water temperatures. The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest climatic zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in the high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents contribute to climatic control by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. Adjacent land areas are affected by the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents. The Gulf Stream, for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and northwestern Europe, and the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of northeastern Canada (the Grand Banks area) and the northwestern coast of Africa. In general, winds tend to transport moisture and warm or cool air over land areas. Hurricanes develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean.


== History ==
The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of the world's oceans, after the Southern Ocean. Evidence indicates that it did not exist prior to 180 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral supercontinent, Pangaea, were being rafted apart by the process of seafloor spreading. The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements were established along its shores. The Vikings, Portuguese, and Christopher Columbus were the most famous among its early explorers. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established. As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the Americas (known as transatlantic trade). Numerous scientific explorations have been undertaken, including those by the German Meteor expedition, Columbia University's Lamont Geological Observatory, and the United States Navy Hydrographic Office.
Some important events in relation to the Atlantic:
In 1858, the first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid by Cyrus Field.
On April 14th 1912 the RMS Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg with loss of 1,593 people.
In 1919, the American NC-4 became the first airplane to cross the Atlantic (though it made a couple of landings on islands along the way).
Later in 1919, a British airplane piloted by Alcock and Brown made the first non-stop transatlantic flight, from Newfoundland to Ireland.
In 1921, the British were the first to cross the North Atlantic in an airship.
In 1922, the Portuguese were the first to cross the South Atlantic in an airship.
The first transatlantic telephone call was made on January 7, 1927.
In 1927, Charles Lindbergh made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an airplane (between New York City and Paris).
In 1998, Ben Lecomte was the first person to swim across the Atlantic Ocean, stopping for only one week in the Azores.
After rowing for 81 days and 4,767 kilometres (2,962 mi), on December 3, 1999, Tori Murden became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by rowboat alone when she reached Guadeloupe from the Canary Islands.


== Economy ==
The ocean has also contributed significantly to the development and economy of the countries around it. Besides its major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves and the world's richest fishing resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major species of fish caught are cod, haddock, hake, herring, and mackerel. The most productive areas include the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, the shelf area off Nova Scotia, Georges Bank off Cape Cod, the Bahama Banks, the waters around Iceland, the Irish Sea, the Dogger Bank of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks. Eel, lobster, and whales have also been taken in great quantities. All these factors, taken together, tremendously enhance the Atlantic's great commercial value. Because of the threats to the ocean environment presented by oil spills, marine debris, and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea, various international treaties exist to reduce some forms of pollution.

Endangered marine species include the manatee, seals, sea lions, turtles, and whales.

The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest ocean, covering approximately one-fifth of the Earth's surface. The ocean's name, derived from Greek mythology, means the "Sea of Atlas." The oldest known mention of this name is contained in The Histories of Herodotus around 450 BC (I 202).
This ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending in a north-south direction and is divided into the North Atlantic and South Atlantic by Equatorial Counter Currents at about 8° North latitude. Bounded by the Americas on the west and Europe and Africa on the east, the Atlantic is linked to the Pacific Ocean by the Arctic Ocean on the north and the Drake Passage on the south. A man-made connection between the Atlantic and Pacific is provided by the Panama Canal. On the east, the dividing line between the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean is the 20° East meridian, running south from Cape Agulhas to Antarctica. The Atlantic is separated from the Arctic by a line from Greenland to northwestern Iceland and then from northeastern Iceland to the southernmost tip of Spitsbergen and then to North Cape in northern Norway.
Covering approximately 20% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic Ocean is second only to the Pacific in size. With its adjacent seas it occupies an area of about 106,400,000 square kilometres (41,100,000 sq mi); without them, it has an area of 82,400,000 square kilometres (31,800,000 sq mi). The land area that drains into the Atlantic is four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans. The volume of the Atlantic Ocean with its adjacent seas is 354,700,000 cubic kilometres (85,100,000 cu mi) and without them 323,600,000 cubic kilometres (77,640,000 cu mi).
The average depths of the Atlantic, with its adjacent seas, is 3,338 metres (10,932 ft); without them it is 3,926 metres (12,881 ft). The greatest depth, 8,605 metres (28,232 ft), is in the Puerto Rico Trench. The width of the Atlantic varies from 2,848 kilometres (1,770 mi) between Brazil and Liberia to about 4,830 kilometres (3,000 mi) between the United States and northern Africa.


== Water characteristics ==

On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest of the world's major oceans; the salinity of the surface waters in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand by mass and varies with latitude and season. Surface salinity values are influenced by evaporation, precipitation, river inflow, and melting of sea ice. Although the minimum salinity values are found just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers flow into the ocean. Maximum salinity values occur at about 25° north and south of the equator, in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.
Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from less than −2 °Celsius to 29 °C (28 °F to 84 °F). Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7 °C to 8 °C (44 °F to 46 °F).
The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses. The North and South Atlantic central waters constitute the surface waters. The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). The North Atlantic deep water reaches depths of as much as 4,000 metres (13,200 ft). The Antarctic bottom water occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 metres (13,200 ft).
Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate a large elongated body of water known as the Sargasso Sea, in which the salinity is noticeably higher than average. The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of seaweed and is also the spawning ground for the European eel.
Because of the Coriolis effect, water in the North Atlantic circulates in a clockwise direction, whereas water circulation in the South Atlantic is counter-clockwise. The south tides in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. The tides are a general wave that moves from south to north. In latitudes above 40° North some east-west oscillation occurs.


== Climate ==

The climate of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent land areas is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as the winds blowing across the waters. Because of the ocean's great capacity for retaining heat, maritime climates are moderate and free of extreme seasonal variations. Precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from the water temperatures. The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest climatic zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in the high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents contribute to climatic control by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. Adjacent land areas are affected by the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents. The Gulf Stream, for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and northwestern Europe, and the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of northeastern Canada (the Grand Banks area) and the northwestern coast of Africa. In general, winds tend to transport moisture and warm or cool air over land areas. Hurricanes develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean.


== History ==
The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of the world's oceans, after the Southern Ocean. Evidence indicates that it did not exist prior to 180 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral supercontinent, Pangaea, were being rafted apart by the process of seafloor spreading. The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements were established along its shores. The Vikings, Portuguese, and Christopher Columbus were the most famous among its early explorers. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established. As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the Americas (known as transatlantic trade). Numerous scientific explorations have been undertaken, including those by the German Meteor expedition, Columbia University's Lamont Geological Observatory, and the United States Navy Hydrographic Office.
Some important events in relation to the Atlantic:
In 1858, the first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid by Cyrus Field.
On April 14th 1912 the RMS Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg with loss of 1,593 people.
In 1919, the American NC-4 became the first airplane to cross the Atlantic (though it made a couple of landings on islands along the way).
Later in 1919, a British airplane piloted by Alcock and Brown made the first non-stop transatlantic flight, from Newfoundland to Ireland.
In 1921, the British were the first to cross the North Atlantic in an airship.
In 1922, the Portuguese were the first to cross the South Atlantic in an airship.
The first transatlantic telephone call was made on January 7, 1927.
In 1927, Charles Lindbergh made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an airplane (between New York City and Paris).
In 1998, Ben Lecomte was the first person to swim across the Atlantic Ocean, stopping for only one week in the Azores.
After rowing for 81 days and 4,767 kilometres (2,962 mi), on December 3, 1999, Tori Murden became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by rowboat alone when she reached Guadeloupe from the Canary Islands.


== Economy ==
The ocean has also contributed significantly to the development and economy of the countries around it. Besides its major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves and the world's richest fishing resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major species of fish caught are cod, haddock, hake, herring, and mackerel. The most productive areas include the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, the shelf area off Nova Scotia, Georges Bank off Cape Cod, the Bahama Banks, the waters around Iceland, the Irish Sea, the Dogger Bank of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks. Eel, lobster, and whales have also been taken in great quantities. All these factors, taken together, tremendously enhance the Atlantic's great commercial value. Because of the threats to the ocean environment presented by oil spills, marine debris, and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea, various international treaties exist to reduce some forms of pollution.


== Current environmental issues ==
Endangered marine species include the manatee, seals, sea lions, turtles, and whales. Drift net fishing is killing dolphins, albatrosses and other seabirds (petrels, auks), hastening the decline of fish stocks and contributing to international disputes. There is municipal sludge pollution off the eastern United States, southern Brazil, and eastern Argentina; oil pollution in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Lake Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.
On June 7, 2006, Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off of the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.

Say Dagupan City (salitan Pangasinan: Siyudad na Dagupan) sakey 3rd class siyudad ed luyag na Pangasinan, Filipinas. Onong ed 2000 census, walay population to ya 130,328 ya too diad 25,921 ya pamilya. According to the same survey, Pangasinan is the most populous province in the Philippines. Located on Lingayen Gulf on the island of Luzon, Dagupan is the chief port and commercial and financial center of the province and Northern Luzon; an active trade is conducted in sugarcane, corn, rice, copra, salt, and an alcoholic liquor produced from the nipa palm. The city is known as the Bangus (milkfish) capital of the Philippines because of its abundance of fresh bangus.
The longest barbecue measured 1,007.56 m (3,305.64 ft) - it was created by the people of Dagupan City on May 3, 2003 as part of the city’s Bangus Festival.


== Geography ==


== History ==


=== Pre-Hispanic times ===
Pangasinan in the 16th century, they found that Lingayen Gulf was already a prosperous entrepot visited by traders from other Asian countries. The Augustinian missionary Juan de la Concepcion noted that the communities at Lingayen, Bolinao and the defunct Binalatongan exercised authority over other communities (called baley in the Pangasinan language) in the area. De la Concepcion also mentioned several other towns but did not identify them.


=== Spanish colonial period ===
The area that is now known as Dagupan was described as marshland thickly covered with mangrove and nipa palm trees. The natives lived along the shoreline and riverbanks of Calmay, Pantal, and Bonuan. But there were also communities in Malaued, Lasip, Pogo, and Bacayao. The natives called the area Bacnotan which would later be incorporated into the encomienda of Lingayen that was established in 1583.
The foreign traders would come to the Lingayen coast to trade gold that was brought down to the area by tribesmen in the Cordillera Mountains. Aside from traders, Filipinos also had experience with pirates from Japan and China. One of the Chinese corsairs was Lim Feng (in Fukienese, Lim A-hong), who would be known in Philippine history as Limahong.
Limahong sailed down the Ilocos coast with 62 ships and attacked Manila on Nov. 30, 1574. The Spanish, however, repulsed Limahong's two attacks. The Chinese corsair repaired to Pangasinan to establish a colony at Bacnotan on December 2, 1574. But the Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo laid siege on his fortress for eight months by blocking the river outlets. Limahong puportedly broke through the siege by digging a channel from the Agno River through the Bacnotan marshes to Lingayen Gulf
In 1661, a big fire hit Bacnotan during the Malong Revolt, led by Andres Malong of Binalatongan, against the forced labor and mandatory sale of local goods imposed by the Spanish colonial government. The fire broke out after Malong sent 3,000 supporters, most of whom were Zambal tribesmen, to Ilocos and Cagayan to fight the Spaniards. The people of Bacnotan, many of whom joined the Spanish in repelling the Zambal marauders, rebuilt the town and renamed it Nandaragupan, meaning where once stood the commercial center, indicating its early importance as a trade, commercial and political center in the region. In 1720, Nandaragupan was chartered as a town but its name was simplified to Dagupan. Malong was eventually beheaded in the city's Pantal bridge in 1661 by Spanish authorities.
Dagupan was also the birthplace of a ladino named Caragay who led another uprising in 1719 against the provincial governor (alcalde mayor, in Spanish) who had him flogged for what appeared to be a false accusation of smuggling. Governor Antonio del Valle had Caragay arrested in the village of Nantagalan, northeast of San Jacinto and Mangaldan and flogged. Vowing vengeance, Caragay organized a band of men who hounded the governor until they were able to kill him. Historians view Caragay as a "model" of the revolts of Palaris and Diego Silang. More than Malong, historians view Caragay as a "model" of the revolts of Palaris and Diego Silang. In 1762, Dagupan would be one of the first towns to join the Palaris Revolt against Spain.
In 1780, Pantal, originally named Pantalan (port), became a trading center and docking station for merchant ships. At about the same time, the bangus industry thrived and mangrove swamps were converted into fishponds, starting the land conversions that would later have an impact on flooding and earthquake damage in the province. The opening of the Pantalan dock eased the transportation of goods from Pangasinan to other parts of the country, spurring the cultivation of idle lands in the eastern part and the development of fishponds in the western part of the province. The new dock also eased communications between the colonial government, its soldiers and the missionaries, who were tasked to colonize the natives in the Cordillera Mountains and the Cagayan Valley region and exploit its gold deposits.
In July 1787, the Spanish began to build a road to connect Pangasinan and the Cagayan Valley, the home of several head-hunting tribesmen who refused to submit to Spanish rule. Although it took several years to complete, the road would play a vital role in the colonization of the Cagayan Valley and the Cordillera Mountains.
The Palaris and Silang revolts, which occurred simultaneously with the British Invasion of the Philippines demonstrated to the Spaniards the importance of ports in Pangasin and Ilocos to the security of the entire island of Luzon. They thus became centers of Spanish governance and acculturation in the 19th century. When the port of Manila was opened to foreign trade in 1830, tobacco from Pangasinan and Cagayan Valley were shipped to the colonial capital via Dagupan and Lingayen. Foreign trading agents also began to make appearances in the two towns, starting a new era of prosperity, especially for the provincial gentry.
The Filipino scholar Maximo Kalaw found the description of the American writer David Barrows as appropriate:
The Filipino had now become embarked upon a new current of intellectual experience -- a course of enlightenment which has been so full of unexpected development... Throughout the islands a class was rapidly growing up to which the new industries had brought wealth. Their means enabled them to build spacious and splendid homes of the fine hardwoods of the Philippines, and to surround themselves with such luxuries as the life of the islands permitted. This class was rapidly gaining education.
This was also true of the Dagupan gentry. Trade enriched many families and allowed them to send their scions to study overseas. These young men returned to the Philippines not only with technical knowledge in their chosen fields but also with the intellectual currents of the time, including constitutional republicanism which swept Spain in 1810.
News from the colonial government in Manila also reached Dagupan at a faster pace with the completion of the Manila-Dagupan Railway in 1891. The railway would play a significant role not only in the economic development of Pangasinan but also in the success of the Philippine Revolution.


=== Under the First Philippine Republic ===
Not much is known of Dagupeños involvement in the Katipunan and the first and second parts of the Philippine Revolution. But on Mar. 7, 1898, the Dagupeños unveiled a coordinated attack on Spanish forces that appears to have been planned months in advance. It is now known as the Battle of Dagupan (1898)
The Dagupeño leaders of the attack were Juan Solis Galvan, Teodoro Villamil, Pedro de Venecia, Macario Meneses and Daniel Maramba. They were under the overall command of Francisco Macabulos, who had just liberated the provinces of Pampanga and Tarlac. He was assisted by Ramon Manalang, who was based in Alaminos. Communications between Macabulos and Manalang was coordinated by Macario Meneses of Bonuan.
The Spanish forces were commanded by Federico Caballos, who had troops garrisoned at all the towns of Pangasinan. In Dagupan, he had men at the Colegio de San Alberto Magno, which guarded the western approach to the town; at the foot of Quintos Bridge, which guarded the east; and his main force at the Catholic Church.
Although the revolutionary forces were ill equipped (most of them armed only with bolos and lances), they attacked the Spanish with an ingenious rolling trench. The "trenches" were made of several banana tree trunks, wrapped in sheets of dried nipa palm leaves. The trenches were seven feet in diameter and the revolutionists would roll the it toward Spanish positions so they could fight them in close quarter with their bolos and lances.
Galvan led the back at the Colegio de San Alberto Magno while Villamil and De Venecia swooped down on the enemies at Quintos Bridge. The Tagalog forces from Nueva Ecija, who were better armed, joined the Dagupeños who attacked the Spanish position at the church. The Dagupeños held the Spanish troops at bay in Dagupan while other revolutionists liberated other towns in the province. Maramba later joined the battle after fighting in Sta. Barbara and Mangaldan.
By July 21, after four months and 16 days, Macabulos unleashed a concerted attack. The Spanish and Filipino troops exchanged fire for two nights and a day before Caballos surrendered on July 23 1898, six weeks after the Declaration of Philippine Independence on June 12, 1898.
After the town returned to normal, President Emilio Aguinaldo named Galvan president of the municipal council. Galvan was a ranking officer of the Katipunan. Galvan Street along which the public market was built was named after him.


=== American colonial period ===
On January 8-9, 1945, U.S. General Douglas MacArthur landed his amphibious liberation force in the city's "Blue Beach" section along the Lingayen Gulf. From his beachhead in Dagupan, along with those in neighboring towns Lingayen and San Fabian, MacArthur's forces under General Walter Krueger were able to penetrate Japanese defenses in Luzon island and liberate Filipino and allied prisoners of war in Manila's University of Sto.

=== Dagupan becomes a city ===
Dagupan became a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 170, authored by Speaker Eugenio Perez. It was signed into law by President Manuel Roxas on June 20, 1947.
On October 15, 1947, President Roxas issued Executive Order No. 96 fixing the city limits to include the towns of San Fabian, Pangasinan and Calasiao, Pangasinan but the residents of Calasiao rejected inclusion into the new city, causing controversy over the election that was held on Nov. 10, 1947.
The dispute was brought before the Supreme Court of the Philippines which subsequently validated the election and ruled that Dagupan became a city on June 20, 1947, when Roxas signed the charter into law.
Despite the controversy attending Dagupan's rise as a city, the new city mayor, Angel B. Fernandez, embarked on an infrastructure program that would develop erswhile idle swamplands toward the south and west.
In 1948, he built a road from barrio Mayombo to barrio Tapuac, passing through the edge of barrio Pogo Chico. The road, built mostly on reclaimed swampland, was named Perez Boulevard, in honor of Dagupan's first lawyer and Assemblyman Rodrigo Perez. The road was needed because of the increasing number of commercial establishments on Torres Bugallon Avenue and the growing number of residents at the southern limits of the city. In 1946, the Dagupan City High School was transferred from Torres Bugallon Avenue. Perez Boulevard expanded the commercial area south especially after Fernandez built a new public market at the bank of the river.
Later, Fernandez's successor Teofilo Guadiz, who served from 1954-1957 and 1958-1959, would also contribute to the city's expansion by extending Rizal Street, which was only then from Torres Bugallon to Rivera Street, up to the Iglesia ni Cristo compound. Also, he extended Galvan Street, which was then up to Gomez Street only, up to Perez Boulevard. He also secured funds from Senator Cipriano P. Primicias Sr., a native of Pangasinan, to build a two-story semi-permanent building for the city high school. Guadiz also replaced the Bailey bridge on Perez Boulevard with a concrete one.
The westward expansion of the city went as far as Lucao which was also swampland. Local historian Restituto Basa surmised that the name Lucao may have been derived from the shellfish called lukan that used to abound in the swampy area.
In June 1962, Dagupan was shaken by a series of strong earthquakes which occurred at irregular intervals for about three weeks. The quakes toppled the belfry of the Roman Catholic Church. The epicenter of the earthquake was in Calmay, where real estate values dropped after the temblors. Many people from Calmay, Carael and island barrios evacuated to other towns.
In 1968, the national government agencies opened offices in Dagupan and other key cities across the country. The daytime population increased sustantially, causing congestion in the city that began to see the appearance of public utility tricycles.
On July 16, 1990, an magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck northern Luzon. The worst hit cities were Cabanatuan, Baguio and Dagupan.
Many public and private structures were destroyed or damaged when river banks slid into the Pantal River and dry land into the swampy areas. Streets were ruptured and the ground subsided, causing buildings to sink by as much as two meters. Other buildings tilted severely, especially along Perez Boulevard. One building tilted by as much as 19 degrees, but generally, the magnitude of tilt was within 2-5 degrees.
There were sand boils in several areas in the city and drainage systems were clogged by the accumulated sand causing temporary flooding of the city's main thoroughfares. Some houses remained underwater by 30-50 cms. for several months. The whole stretch of Don Jose Calimlim Street and swampy areas and fishpond communities, such as Barangay Lasip Grande, remained underwater even during low tide conditions.

At the height of the earthquake, an eyewitness told experts of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology that he saw rolling during the earthquake and a jeep parked along the road vanished from his sight.
Scientists blamed the destruction on the liquefaction of land that was had not compacted enough since it was reclaimed from the swamp or marsh. It was also blamed on the active shifting of Pantal River, which left abandoned meanders on which people built structures. Varying degrees of damage were sustained in the different affected areas of Dagupan City. Phivolcs said a study of the damage during the earthquake indicate that susceptibility to liquefaction in different parts of Dagupan City can be related to the relative ages of the geologic features and the deposits underlying them.
The degree of destruction along A.B. Fernandez Avenue, which largely lies on reclaimed swampland, was generally less than that in the Perez Blvd. area except near its intersection with Rizal Street. The great degree of liquefaction along a 100m stretch of A.B. Fernandez Ave. can be traced to changes in the channel of Pantal River. Prior to north eastward expansion of Dagupan City, Pantal River used to meander around the area now partly occupied by A.B. Fernandez Ave. and Rizal St. before running parallel to Pantal Road.

Sagor na Baybay na Luzon Region (Northwestern Luzon Region) or Region 1 of the Philippines is located in the northwestern part of Luzon. It is bounded by Cordillera Administrative Region and Cagayan Valley to the east, Central Luzon to the south and by the South China Sea to the west.
The region is composed of four provinces, namely: Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union and Pangasinan. Its regional center is San Fernando City, La Union. The region is occupied 70% by Ilocanos and 28% by Pangasinenses.
Although the Philippine government designated Region 1 as the Ilocos Region, many people find the designated name of the region as ethno-centric. Many people find the name Northwestern Region, which is geographically deduced, as the more appropriate term.


== People and culture ==
The Ilocos provinces of Region 1 is the historical homeland of the Ilocanos. The Ilocanos have the following percentage of the population inside the bracket in each province: Pangasinan (43%), La Union (92%), Ilocos Norte (97%), and Ilocos Sur (93%). Pangasinan is the historical homeland of the Pangasinenses. The population of Pangasinan composed around 60% of the whole population of the region. The Pangasinenses presently constitute around 50% of the population of the province. The province was not originally part of the Region 1. It was only during the time of President Marcos, when Pangasinan was included in the province. Minority groups include the Tingguian and Isneg communities that inhabit the foothills of the Cordillera mountains.
The population is predominantly Roman Catholic with strong adherents of Protestantism such as the Aglipayan denomination further north of the country. There is also an undercurrent of traditional animistic beliefs especially in rural areas. The small mercantile Chinese and Indian communities are primarily Buddhists and Hindus respectively


== Economy ==
Although the economy in the southern portion of the region, esp. Pangasinan, is anchored in agro-industial and service industry, the economy in the northern portion of the region is anchored in the agricultural sector. The economy in Pangasinan is driven by agro-industrial businesses, such as milkfish (bangus) cultivation and processing, livestock raising, fish paste processing (bagoong), and others. At the same time the importance of trading, financial services, and educational services in the economy cannot be denied. Income in the northern portion mostly come from cultivating rice, tobacco, corn, sugarcane, and fruits; raising livestock such as pigs, chicken, goats, and carabaos (water buffalos).
The distribution of the economic activity in the region may be seen from the collection of tax revenue of the national government. According to the data from the Statistical Coordination Board, the bulk of the collections come from Pangasinan, which posted 61% of the total.
The service and light manufacturing industries are concentrated in the cities. Dagupan City is mostly driven by its local entrepreneurs, which have started to expand its network up to the national level. San Fernando City in La Union also has an active shipping port and Laoag City in Ilocos Norte has a growing international airport. The government is one of the largest employers along with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola.
The tourism industry focuses on the coastal beaches and on eco-tourism. There are fine sands stretching along Bauang, La Union and the rest of the region. Opportunities to engage in other water sports and activities abound. Eco-tourism takes advantage of the marine and forest resources in the region and displays the natural beauty of the Ilocos.
The region is also rich in crafts, with renowned blanket-weaving and pottery. Their burnay pottery is well known for its dark colored clay.


== Political Division ==
Region 1 is composed of 4 provinces and a total of 9 cities.


==== Component Cities ====
Alaminos City, Pangasinan
Siyudad na Candon, Ilocos Sur
Dagupan City , Pangasinan
Laoag City, Ilocos Norte
Urdaneta City, Pangasinan
Siyudad na San Carlos, Pangasinan

Siyudad na Vigan, Ilocos Sur


=== Physical ===
Region 1 occupies the narrow plain between the Cordillera Central mountain range and the South China Sea. It also occupies the northern portion of the Central Luzon plain, to the northeast of the Zambales Mountains.
Lingayen Gulf is the most notable body of water in the region and it contains a number of islands, including the Hundred Islands National Park. To the north of the region is Luzon Strait.
The Agno river runs through Pangasinan and empties into Lingayen Gulf. The river flow into a broad delta in the vicinity of Lingayen and Dagupan City.


== Tourist Attractions ==
Hundred Islands National Park. Located in the Lingayen Gulf in Pangasinan, the watery park is dotted by 123 small, pristine islands. Three islands have been developed for tourists.
Vigan colonial houses. Vigan City is famous for its cobblestone streets and Spanish-style houses, an architectural remnant of its colonial past. The Mestizo District displays mansions typical of the era. They were owned by prominent Ilocano-Chinese merchant families of that time, hence mestizo or "mixed race."
Ancient churches. The region is dotted by old Catholic churches built by natives for the Spanish. Famous churches can be found in Vigan City, once the seat of the Bishop of Nueva Segovia, and in Manaoag, Pangasinan.


== History ==
Region 1 was first inhabited by the aboriginal Negritos before they were pushed by successive waves of Malay immigrants that penetrated the narrow coast. Tingguians in the interior, Ilocanos in the north, and Pangasinense in the south settled the region.
The Spanish arrived in the 16th century and established Christian missions and governmental institutions to control the native population and convert them to the Roman Catholic church. Present-day Vigan City in Ilocos Sur province became the bishopric seat of Nueva Segovia. Proud Ilocanos in the northern parts were less easily swayed, however, and remained an area filled with deep resentments against Spain. These resentments bubbled to the surface at various points in the region's history as insurrections. According to Nick Joaquin in his book Culture and History, the Pangasinenses were the last to be stand against the Spaniards.
The most notable of the rebellions were that of Andres Malong and Palaris of Pangasinan,Diego Silang and his wife Gabriela Silang in 1764, and the Basi Revolt in the 19th century.
In 1901, the region went under American colonial rule, and in 1941, under Japanese occupation.
Several modern presidents of the Republic of the Philippines hailed from the Region: Elpidio Quirino, Ferdinand Marcos, and Fidel Ramos.
Before the Cordillera Administrative Region was formed, Region 1 also included the provinces of Abra, Mountain Province, and Benguet.Ipatalos yo pa ya ed salitan Pangasinan. Sarag yon dagdagan o bawasan. Salamat.

The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest ocean, covering approximately one-fifth of the Earth's surface. The ocean's name, derived from Greek mythology, means the "Sea of Atlas." The oldest known mention of this name is contained in The Histories of Herodotus around 450 BC (I 202).
This ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending in a north-south direction and is divided into the North Atlantic and South Atlantic by Equatorial Counter Currents at about 8° North latitude. Bounded by the Americas on the west and Europe and Africa on the east, the Atlantic is linked to the Pacific Ocean by the Arctic Ocean on the north and the Drake Passage on the south. A man-made connection between the Atlantic and Pacific is provided by the Panama Canal. On the east, the dividing line between the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean is the 20° East meridian, running south from Cape Agulhas to Antarctica. The Atlantic is separated from the Arctic by a line from Greenland to northwestern Iceland and then from northeastern Iceland to the southernmost tip of Spitsbergen and then to North Cape in northern Norway.
Covering approximately 20% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic Ocean is second only to the Pacific in size. With its adjacent seas it occupies an area of about 106,400,000 square kilometres (41,100,000 sq mi); without them, it has an area of 82,400,000 square kilometres (31,800,000 sq mi). The land area that drains into the Atlantic is four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans. The volume of the Atlantic Ocean with its adjacent seas is 354,700,000 cubic kilometres (85,100,000 cu mi) and without them 323,600,000 cubic kilometres (77,640,000 cu mi).
The average depths of the Atlantic, with its adjacent seas, is 3,338 metres (10,932 ft); without them it is 3,926 metres (12,881 ft). The greatest depth, 8,605 metres (28,232 ft), is in the Puerto Rico Trench. The width of the Atlantic varies from 2,848 kilometres (1,770 mi) between Brazil and Liberia to about 4,830 kilometres (3,000 mi) between the United States and northern Africa.


== Water characteristics ==

On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest of the world's major oceans; the salinity of the surface waters in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand by mass and varies with latitude and season. Surface salinity values are influenced by evaporation, precipitation, river inflow, and melting of sea ice. Although the minimum salinity values are found just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers flow into the ocean. Maximum salinity values occur at about 25° north and south of the equator, in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.
Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from less than −2 °Celsius to 29 °C (28 °F to 84 °F). Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7 °C to 8 °C (44 °F to 46 °F).
The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses. The North and South Atlantic central waters constitute the surface waters. The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). The North Atlantic deep water reaches depths of as much as 4,000 metres (13,200 ft). The Antarctic bottom water occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 metres (13,200 ft).
Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate a large elongated body of water known as the Sargasso Sea, in which the salinity is noticeably higher than average. The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of seaweed and is also the spawning ground for the European eel.
Because of the Coriolis effect, water in the North Atlantic circulates in a clockwise direction, whereas water circulation in the South Atlantic is counter-clockwise. The south tides in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. The tides are a general wave that moves from south to north. In latitudes above 40° North some east-west oscillation occurs.


== Climate ==

The climate of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent land areas is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as the winds blowing across the waters. Because of the ocean's great capacity for retaining heat, maritime climates are moderate and free of extreme seasonal variations. Precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from the water temperatures. The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest climatic zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in the high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents contribute to climatic control by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. Adjacent land areas are affected by the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents. The Gulf Stream, for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and northwestern Europe, and the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of northeastern Canada (the Grand Banks area) and the northwestern coast of Africa. In general, winds tend to transport moisture and warm or cool air over land areas. Hurricanes develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean.


== History ==
The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of the world's oceans, after the Southern Ocean. Evidence indicates that it did not exist prior to 180 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral supercontinent, Pangaea, were being rafted apart by the process of seafloor spreading. The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements were established along its shores. The Vikings, Portuguese, and Christopher Columbus were the most famous among its early explorers. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established. As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the Americas (known as transatlantic trade). Numerous scientific explorations have been undertaken, including those by the German Meteor expedition, Columbia University's Lamont Geological Observatory, and the United States Navy Hydrographic Office.
Some important events in relation to the Atlantic:
In 1858, the first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid by Cyrus Field.
On April 14th 1912 the RMS Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg with loss of 1,593 people.
In 1919, the American NC-4 became the first airplane to cross the Atlantic (though it made a couple of landings on islands along the way).
Later in 1919, a British airplane piloted by Alcock and Brown made the first non-stop transatlantic flight, from Newfoundland to Ireland.
In 1921, the British were the first to cross the North Atlantic in an airship.
In 1922, the Portuguese were the first to cross the South Atlantic in an airship.
The first transatlantic telephone call was made on January 7, 1927.
In 1927, Charles Lindbergh made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an airplane (between New York City and Paris).
In 1998, Ben Lecomte was the first person to swim across the Atlantic Ocean, stopping for only one week in the Azores.
After rowing for 81 days and 4,767 kilometres (2,962 mi), on December 3, 1999, Tori Murden became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by rowboat alone when she reached Guadeloupe from the Canary Islands.


== Economy ==
The ocean has also contributed significantly to the development and economy of the countries around it. Besides its major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves and the world's richest fishing resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major species of fish caught are cod, haddock, hake, herring, and mackerel. The most productive areas include the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, the shelf area off Nova Scotia, Georges Bank off Cape Cod, the Bahama Banks, the waters around Iceland, the Irish Sea, the Dogger Bank of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks. Eel, lobster, and whales have also been taken in great quantities. All these factors, taken together, tremendously enhance the Atlantic's great commercial value. Because of the threats to the ocean environment presented by oil spills, marine debris, and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea, various international treaties exist to reduce some forms of pollution.


== Current environmental issues ==
Endangered marine species include the manatee, seals, sea lions, turtles, and whales. Drift net fishing is killing dolphins, albatrosses and other seabirds (petrels, auks), hastening the decline of fish stocks and contributing to international disputes. There is municipal sludge pollution off the eastern United States, southern Brazil, and eastern Argentina; oil pollution in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Lake Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.
On June 7, 2006, Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off of the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.

The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest ocean, covering approximately one-fifth of the Earth's surface. The ocean's name, derived from Greek mythology, means the "Sea of Atlas." The oldest known mention of this name is contained in The Histories of Herodotus around 450 BC (I 202).
This ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending in a north-south direction and is divided into the North Atlantic and South Atlantic by Equatorial Counter Currents at about 8° North latitude. Bounded by the Americas on the west and Europe and Africa on the east, the Atlantic is linked to the Pacific Ocean by the Arctic Ocean on the north and the Drake Passage on the south. A man-made connection between the Atlantic and Pacific is provided by the Panama Canal. On the east, the dividing line between the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean is the 20° East meridian, running south from Cape Agulhas to Antarctica. The Atlantic is separated from the Arctic by a line from Greenland to northwestern Iceland and then from northeastern Iceland to the southernmost tip of Spitsbergen and then to North Cape in northern Norway.
Covering approximately 20% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic Ocean is second only to the Pacific in size. With its adjacent seas it occupies an area of about 106,400,000 square kilometres (41,100,000 sq mi); without them, it has an area of 82,400,000 square kilometres (31,800,000 sq mi). The land area that drains into the Atlantic is four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans. The volume of the Atlantic Ocean with its adjacent seas is 354,700,000 cubic kilometres (85,100,000 cu mi) and without them 323,600,000 cubic kilometres (77,640,000 cu mi).
The average depths of the Atlantic, with its adjacent seas, is 3,338 metres (10,932 ft); without them it is 3,926 metres (12,881 ft). The greatest depth, 8,605 metres (28,232 ft), is in the Puerto Rico Trench. The width of the Atlantic varies from 2,848 kilometres (1,770 mi) between Brazil and Liberia to about 4,830 kilometres (3,000 mi) between the United States and northern Africa.


== Water characteristics ==

On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest of the world's major oceans; the salinity of the surface waters in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand by mass and varies with latitude and season. Surface salinity values are influenced by evaporation, precipitation, river inflow, and melting of sea ice. Although the minimum salinity values are found just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers flow into the ocean. Maximum salinity values occur at about 25° north and south of the equator, in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.
Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from less than −2 °Celsius to 29 °C (28 °F to 84 °F). Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7 °C to 8 °C (44 °F to 46 °F).
The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses. The North and South Atlantic central waters constitute the surface waters. The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). The North Atlantic deep water reaches depths of as much as 4,000 metres (13,200 ft). The Antarctic bottom water occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 metres (13,200 ft).
Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate a large elongated body of water known as the Sargasso Sea, in which the salinity is noticeably higher than average. The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of seaweed and is also the spawning ground for the European eel.
Because of the Coriolis effect, water in the North Atlantic circulates in a clockwise direction, whereas water circulation in the South Atlantic is counter-clockwise. The south tides in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. The tides are a general wave that moves from south to north. In latitudes above 40° North some east-west oscillation occurs.


== Climate ==

The climate of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent land areas is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as the winds blowing across the waters. Because of the ocean's great capacity for retaining heat, maritime climates are moderate and free of extreme seasonal variations. Precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from the water temperatures. The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest climatic zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in the high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents contribute to climatic control by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. Adjacent land areas are affected by the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents. The Gulf Stream, for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and northwestern Europe, and the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of northeastern Canada (the Grand Banks area) and the northwestern coast of Africa. In general, winds tend to transport moisture and warm or cool air over land areas. Hurricanes develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean.


== History ==
The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of the world's oceans, after the Southern Ocean. Evidence indicates that it did not exist prior to 180 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral supercontinent, Pangaea, were being rafted apart by the process of seafloor spreading. The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements were established along its shores. The Vikings, Portuguese, and Christopher Columbus were the most famous among its early explorers. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established. As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the Americas (known as transatlantic trade). Numerous scientific explorations have been undertaken, including those by the German Meteor expedition, Columbia University's Lamont Geological Observatory, and the United States Navy Hydrographic Office.
Some important events in relation to the Atlantic:
In 1858, the first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid by Cyrus Field.
On April 14th 1912 the RMS Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg with loss of 1,593 people.
In 1919, the American NC-4 became the first airplane to cross the Atlantic (though it made a couple of landings on islands along the way).
Later in 1919, a British airplane piloted by Alcock and Brown made the first non-stop transatlantic flight, from Newfoundland to Ireland.
In 1921, the British were the first to cross the North Atlantic in an airship.
In 1922, the Portuguese were the first to cross the South Atlantic in an airship.
The first transatlantic telephone call was made on January 7, 1927.
In 1927, Charles Lindbergh made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an airplane (between New York City and Paris).
In 1998, Ben Lecomte was the first person to swim across the Atlantic Ocean, stopping for only one week in the Azores.
After rowing for 81 days and 4,767 kilometres (2,962 mi), on December 3, 1999, Tori Murden became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by rowboat alone when she reached Guadeloupe from the Canary Islands.


== Economy ==
The ocean has also contributed significantly to the development and economy of the countries around it. Besides its major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves and the world's richest fishing resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major species of fish caught are cod, haddock, hake, herring, and mackerel. The most productive areas include the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, the shelf area off Nova Scotia, Georges Bank off Cape Cod, the Bahama Banks, the waters around Iceland, the Irish Sea, the Dogger Bank of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks. Eel, lobster, and whales have also been taken in great quantities. All these factors, taken together, tremendously enhance the Atlantic's great commercial value. Because of the threats to the ocean environment presented by oil spills, marine debris, and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea, various international treaties exist to reduce some forms of pollution.


== Current environmental issues ==
Endangered marine species include the manatee, seals, sea lions, turtles, and whales. Drift net fishing is killing dolphins, albatrosses and other seabirds (petrels, auks), hastening the decline of fish stocks and contributing to international disputes. There is municipal sludge pollution off the eastern United States, southern Brazil, and eastern Argentina; oil pollution in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Lake Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.
On June 7, 2006, Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off of the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.

Europe is the world's second-smallest continent in terms of area, covering about 10 400 000 square kilometres (4,010,000 sq mi) or 2.0% of the Earth's surface. The only continent smaller than Europe is Australia. In terms of population, it is the third-largest continent (after Asia and Afrika) with a population of some 710,000,000, or about 11% of the world's population.
The European Union – comprising 25 member states, with two countries acceding in 2007 (Bulgaria and Romania) and two candidates in accession negotiations (Turkey and Croatia) – is the largest political and economic entity covering the European continent, while Russia (excluding portions in Asia) is the second largest entity and Europe's largest state in area and population.

== Historiya ==
Indang (ursprünglich: Indan) wurde 1655 eine selbstständige Gemeinde, nachdem der Ort zuvor zu Silang gehört hatte. Der Name Indan leitet sich vom Tagalog Wort indang oder inrang für eine Baumart, die in diesem Gebiet vorkam, ab.

The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest ocean, covering approximately one-fifth of the Earth's surface. The ocean's name, derived from Greek mythology, means the "Sea of Atlas." The oldest known mention of this name is contained in The Histories of Herodotus around 450 BC (I 202).
This ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending in a north-south direction and is divided into the North Atlantic and South Atlantic by Equatorial Counter Currents at about 8° North latitude. Bounded by the Americas on the west and Europe and Africa on the east, the Atlantic is linked to the Pacific Ocean by the Arctic Ocean on the north and the Drake Passage on the south. A man-made connection between the Atlantic and Pacific is provided by the Panama Canal. On the east, the dividing line between the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean is the 20° East meridian, running south from Cape Agulhas to Antarctica. The Atlantic is separated from the Arctic by a line from Greenland to northwestern Iceland and then from northeastern Iceland to the southernmost tip of Spitsbergen and then to North Cape in northern Norway.
Covering approximately 20% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic Ocean is second only to the Pacific in size. With its adjacent seas it occupies an area of about 106,400,000 square kilometres (41,100,000 sq mi); without them, it has an area of 82,400,000 square kilometres (31,800,000 sq mi). The land area that drains into the Atlantic is four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans. The volume of the Atlantic Ocean with its adjacent seas is 354,700,000 cubic kilometres (85,100,000 cu mi) and without them 323,600,000 cubic kilometres (77,640,000 cu mi).
The average depths of the Atlantic, with its adjacent seas, is 3,338 metres (10,932 ft); without them it is 3,926 metres (12,881 ft). The greatest depth, 8,605 metres (28,232 ft), is in the Puerto Rico Trench. The width of the Atlantic varies from 2,848 kilometres (1,770 mi) between Brazil and Liberia to about 4,830 kilometres (3,000 mi) between the United States and northern Africa.


== Water characteristics ==

On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest of the world's major oceans; the salinity of the surface waters in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand by mass and varies with latitude and season. Surface salinity values are influenced by evaporation, precipitation, river inflow, and melting of sea ice. Although the minimum salinity values are found just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers flow into the ocean. Maximum salinity values occur at about 25° north and south of the equator, in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.
Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from less than −2 °Celsius to 29 °C (28 °F to 84 °F). Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7 °C to 8 °C (44 °F to 46 °F).
The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses. The North and South Atlantic central waters constitute the surface waters. The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). The North Atlantic deep water reaches depths of as much as 4,000 metres (13,200 ft). The Antarctic bottom water occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 metres (13,200 ft).
Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate a large elongated body of water known as the Sargasso Sea, in which the salinity is noticeably higher than average. The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of seaweed and is also the spawning ground for the European eel.
Because of the Coriolis effect, water in the North Atlantic circulates in a clockwise direction, whereas water circulation in the South Atlantic is counter-clockwise. The south tides in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. The tides are a general wave that moves from south to north. In latitudes above 40° North some east-west oscillation occurs.


== Climate ==

The climate of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent land areas is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as the winds blowing across the waters. Because of the ocean's great capacity for retaining heat, maritime climates are moderate and free of extreme seasonal variations. Precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from the water temperatures. The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest climatic zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in the high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents contribute to climatic control by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. Adjacent land areas are affected by the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents. The Gulf Stream, for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and northwestern Europe, and the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of northeastern Canada (the Grand Banks area) and the northwestern coast of Africa. In general, winds tend to transport moisture and warm or cool air over land areas. Hurricanes develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean.


== History ==
The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of the world's oceans, after the Southern Ocean. Evidence indicates that it did not exist prior to 180 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral supercontinent, Pangaea, were being rafted apart by the process of seafloor spreading. The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements were established along its shores. The Vikings, Portuguese, and Christopher Columbus were the most famous among its early explorers. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established. As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the Americas (known as transatlantic trade). Numerous scientific explorations have been undertaken, including those by the German Meteor expedition, Columbia University's Lamont Geological Observatory, and the United States Navy Hydrographic Office.
Some important events in relation to the Atlantic:
In 1858, the first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid by Cyrus Field.
On April 14th 1912 the RMS Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg with loss of 1,593 people.
In 1919, the American NC-4 became the first airplane to cross the Atlantic (though it made a couple of landings on islands along the way).
Later in 1919, a British airplane piloted by Alcock and Brown made the first non-stop transatlantic flight, from Newfoundland to Ireland.
In 1921, the British were the first to cross the North Atlantic in an airship.
In 1922, the Portuguese were the first to cross the South Atlantic in an airship.
The first transatlantic telephone call was made on January 7, 1927.
In 1927, Charles Lindbergh made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an airplane (between New York City and Paris).
In 1998, Ben Lecomte was the first person to swim across the Atlantic Ocean, stopping for only one week in the Azores.
After rowing for 81 days and 4,767 kilometres (2,962 mi), on December 3, 1999, Tori Murden became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by rowboat alone when she reached Guadeloupe from the Canary Islands.


== Economy ==
The ocean has also contributed significantly to the development and economy of the countries around it. Besides its major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves and the world's richest fishing resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major species of fish caught are cod, haddock, hake, herring, and mackerel. The most productive areas include the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, the shelf area off Nova Scotia, Georges Bank off Cape Cod, the Bahama Banks, the waters around Iceland, the Irish Sea, the Dogger Bank of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks. Eel, lobster, and whales have also been taken in great quantities. All these factors, taken together, tremendously enhance the Atlantic's great commercial value. Because of the threats to the ocean environment presented by oil spills, marine debris, and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea, various international treaties exist to reduce some forms of pollution.


== Current environmental issues ==
Endangered marine species include the manatee, seals, sea lions, turtles, and whales. Drift net fishing is killing dolphins, albatrosses and other seabirds (petrels, auks), hastening the decline of fish stocks and contributing to international disputes. There is municipal sludge pollution off the eastern United States, southern Brazil, and eastern Argentina; oil pollution in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Lake Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.
On June 7, 2006, Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off of the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.
