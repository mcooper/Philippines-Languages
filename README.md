# Philippines-Languages
This is a repo to store some useful scripts and data from a project I did in 2014.

The project was to collect a million tweets from the Philippines using R, and then determine the language they were written in, using corpora from religious and literary texts, as well as corpora scraped from Wikipedia using the python package BeautifulSoup.

The results are on [my blog](http://theresalwaysmoretolearn.blogspot.com/2014/07/philippines-language-maps-language-maps.html).
